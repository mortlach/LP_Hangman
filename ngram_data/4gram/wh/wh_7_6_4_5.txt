whisper behind their backs M 115
whereby indeed these dwell M 102
whiskey flowed like water D 427
whipped through three towns D 330
whirled through more space D 272
whistling through their fingers D 242
whirled around three times D 192
whistle through their fingers D 152
wheedle anyone into letting D 132
whipped across their faces D 126
whereby neither side would D 88
wherein lovers take pride D 86
whistle through their noses D 49

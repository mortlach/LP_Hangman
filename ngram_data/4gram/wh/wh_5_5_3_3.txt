whose fancy does not D 80
whose faces they did D 80
whose chief was one D 80
whole scene was going D 80
whole front row was D 80
whole fleet that had D 80
whole fleet did not D 80
whole duchy was but D 80
whole court with his D 80
whole corps with him D 80
white tunic and with D 80
white skirt with her D 80
white paint and with D 80
white necks and fat D 80
white horse was real D 80
white horse has not D 80
white horse and who D 80
white flesh with its D 80
white flash and then D 80
white faces and set D 80
white ducks and his D 80
white chief was going D 80
while weeping for her D 80
while smoking and set D 80
while pipes with his D 80
while dancing was going D 80
while dancing they put D 80
while bench and bar D 80
which would wean them D 80
which would tie all D 80
which would not ill D 80
which would let his D 80
which would jar with D 80
which would for any D 80
which sweet path thou D 80
which stalk our earth D 80
which plays out its D 80
which peter had long D 80
which moses led them D 80
which might tie his D 80
which makes one sex D 80
which lasts all one D 80
which lacks but one D 80
which froze them with D 80
which flags you may D 80
which fancy and wit D 80
which clash with this D 80
which broke her hip D 80
where serving men and D 80
where every art was D 80
wheel broke off and D 80
whaling ships that had D 80
whose chief and head D 67
wheel drive and two D 64
which swept them out D 63
which would but ill D 60
whirl round his head D 59
white shirt and that D 56
which faces due east D 56
whole would mean that D 55
while pleading with her D 55
while harry was out D 55
whose tongue hung out D 53
which drove you out D 53
where every one sung D 53
white dress and that D 52
while telling her she D 52
while kissing her and D 51
white horse was one D 50
while kissing him and D 50
which fancy oft doth D 50
which would long ere D 49
which would mean far D 48
which spell out that D 48
where rocks jut out D 48
white flour and that D 47
while keeping his ears D 47
white roses and ivy D 46
which suits but ill D 46
while dancing with joy D 45
which would use one D 45
where would any one D 45
whaling fleet that had D 45
whose tongue was far D 44
whose studio was near D 44
white shirt and two D 44
while puffing out his D 44
while driving and that D 44
which would now bear D 44
which would leap out D 44
which throws men out D 44
where heaven met earth D 44
white horse inn that D 43
while trade does not D 43
which tired him out D 43
which shows that oil D 43

whole bible and that D 41
while still too hot D 41
while roger and his D 41
while pleading with them D 41
while peter was out D 41
which would then cut D 41
which would let one D 41
whose sword was that D 40
whose lamps are out D 40
whirl above his head D 40
which shows that per D 40
which paper and ink D 40

era has dawned upon M 1008
ere they reached their M 826
era had dawned upon M 816
era had passed away M 554
era has already been M 376
ere long arrive when M 368
era had already been M 348
era has always been M 340
ere they turned their M 318
era that lasted from M 278
ere his shadow pass M 248
ere she reached upon M 221
ere now created vast M 210
era has passed away M 208
err that devise evil M 203
era has passed when M 194
ere his wounds were M 172
ere you should know M 126
ere they should have M 124
ere her glance fell M 120
era was almost over M 118
era has become more M 118
ere his strength went M 114
ere that moment come M 112
era was already over M 112
era had always been M 112
ere his person came M 110
era has passed into M 108
ere they passed away M 105
era had passed when M 104
ere they reached home M 102
ere our forces leave M 102
era had breathed upon M 102
era had passed into M 100
ere bad should come M 92
ere you accept those M 90
err but little from M 88
ere long follow their M 82
ere this reaches your M 80
era and resume past M 80
ere this should have M 67
ere she should have M 59
ere she passed away M 53
era was little more M 42
ere death should come M 41
ere she rouses from D 142
ere our swords were D 124
ere his solemn step D 116
ere his hammer fell D 104

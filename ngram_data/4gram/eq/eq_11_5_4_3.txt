equivalence holds only for M 196
equivalence where there was M 82
equilibrium growth rate and D 243
equilibrium growth rate for D 234
equilibrium price will not D 228
equilibrium level such that D 225
equilibrium where there are D 194
equilibrium state such that D 187
equilibrium under their own D 171
equilibrium point such that D 169
equilibrium which means that D 145
equilibrium point will not D 145
equilibrium state will not D 134
equilibrium either like that D 132
equilibrium growth rate can D 127
equilibrium value such that D 126
equilibrium breaks down and D 121
equilibrium under these two D 120
equilibrium comes into being D 114
equilibrium point will lie D 98
equilibrium price will then D 80
equilibrium point must lie D 45
equilibrium within their own D 41

take the bikes out D 42
take my black ass D 42
tank to catch and D 41
talk of plows and D 41
taking the fleet out D 41
take the drugs out D 41
take the cramp out D 41
take me where thou D 41
talk of serving god D 40
taking the plunge that D 40
taking the frost out D 40
take the licking that D 40
take the dolls out D 40

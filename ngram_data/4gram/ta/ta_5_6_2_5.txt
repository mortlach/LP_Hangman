takes refuge in poetry D 82
taken aboard the boats D 82
taxes should be fully D 80
talking instead of sitting D 80
talking around the topic D 80
taken across the canal D 80
table fronting the bench D 80
taper toward the front D 68
taken through the rivet D 63
taper toward the point D 62
table should be level D 50
talks around the issue D 49
talks before he thinks D 48
tatty around the edges D 47
talks through the night D 47
table beside the leather D 47
taken scores of lives D 46
takes widens the breach D 43
taped across the front D 41

gearing up for a D 11050
gene is not a D 1676
gets to wear a D 762
gears up for a D 479
gene so that a D 300
germ is not a D 212
gene by using a D 204
gene is thus a D 160
gears to cut a D 145
gets the peas a D 107
gene or with a D 100
gears so that a D 100
gene is now a D 90
gene is that a D 82

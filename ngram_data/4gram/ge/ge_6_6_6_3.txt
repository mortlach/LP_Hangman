gentle little fellow that M 190
gentle spirit without that M 184
gentle speech induce them M 178
gentle maiden ladies who M 168
gently closed behind him M 114
gender issues should not M 87
gently closed behind her M 86
gentle breeze played with D 220
gender equity issues and D 198
gentle rippling noises with D 178
gender parody reveals that D 148
gentle solemn spirit doth D 142
genius allies itself with D 138
gently floating seaward with D 124
genius boldly staked and D 120
gentle tissue handling and D 112
gentle zephyr raised her D 104
gentle tremor through all D 104
gentle breeze lifted her D 100
genius should kindle its D 92
gentle murmur glides thou D 80

my soul cast down D 47
my arms grew numb D 46
my wife made such D 45
my feet sink down D 45
my heart sank deep D 44
my will unto thine D 43
my ride very much D 43
my nose into such D 43
my soul into thine D 42
my poor wife very D 42
my mood even more D 42
my boss came over D 42
my boat over there D 42
my leaving here early D 41
my eyes slid down D 41
my butt over there D 41

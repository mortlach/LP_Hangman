my lady sobbed and D 88
my lady abbess and D 88
my knee joints and D 88
my home office was D 88
my heart thrilling with D 88
my heart ablaze with D 88
my finger inside his D 88
my finger around its D 88
my dumb homage with D 88
my coat collar was D 88
my butt kicked for D 88
my body struck and D 88
my belt buckle was D 88
my wife showed her D 86
my wife changed her D 86
my thumb across her D 86
my soul opened its D 86
my soul faints for D 86
my skin burned and D 86
my shoes shined this D 86
my rope around his D 86
my reading skills and D 86
my poor nephew and D 86
my mouth watering and D 86
my most ardent fan D 86
my mind swarms with D 86
my lips lifted and D 86
my life jacket was D 86
my knee before that D 86
my high notions and D 86
my hiding places and D 86
my finger toward him D 86
my face swelling and D 86
my best friend tom D 86
my bare ankles and D 86
my wife engaged not D 84
my vote counts for D 84
my soul hungering and D 84
my rose bushes and D 84
my rope around her D 84
my room shouting that D 84
my poor cousin did D 84
my main findings and D 84
my hook baited with D 84
my heart sighed for D 84
my heart bleeds that D 84
my hair permed and D 84
my guts inside out D 84
my gaze locked with D 84
my gaping wounds are D 84
my firm belief she D 84
my finger inside you D 84
my body supple and D 84
my boat ashore and D 84
my blue collar and D 84
my most pressing and D 83
my wife shared with D 82
my many drafts and D 82
my loving family who D 82
my half turkey was D 82
my full salary and D 82
my five clerks and D 82
my firm nerves she D 82
my face dripping with D 82
my dull mulish way D 82
my body rocked with D 82
my aching joints and D 82
my wife picked out D 81
my anger blazed out D 81
my wife twists his D 80
my voting record and D 80
my tiny bottle and D 80
my suit should not D 80
my soul through this D 80
my soul seemed one D 80
my sole reward being D 80
my side numbed and D 80
my rash assent has D 80
my mouth before his D 80
my legs raised and D 80
my last flower off D 80
my last dollar was D 80
my kind uncles and D 80
my home planet and D 80
my heart knocks with D 80
my heart dilate and D 80
my having driven out D 80
my fist through one D 80
my feet hissed and D 80
my coat lapels and D 80
my bread without being D 80
my body screams for D 80
my best places for D 80
my back pocket all D 80
my soul praise thee D 65

my desk drawer that D 54
my lord deputy that D 52
my home office that D 52
my good graces that D 48
my coat pocket that D 46
my eyes sticking out D 42
my soul poured out D 41
my wife before that D 40
my mind blanks out D 40

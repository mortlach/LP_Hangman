my little morsel of D 80
my little monkey is D 80
my lately desiring to D 80
my jacket pocket on D 80
my granny taught me D 80
my former station as D 80
my faulty memory as D 80
my esteem blinds me D 80
my family packed up D 70
my energy levels up D 60
my jacket pocket so D 51
my brother jumped up D 48
my temper flared up D 43
my native county as D 40
my cheeks fallen in D 40

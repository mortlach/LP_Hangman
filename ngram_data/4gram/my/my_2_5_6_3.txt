my rough riders with D 84
my nerve failed and D 84
my music career was D 84
my mother adores her D 84
my horse bright and D 84
my front bumper and D 84
my first barrel and D 84
my fingers sticky with D 84
my father shouting and D 84
my chief prayer for D 84
my badge number and D 84
my white shirts and D 82
my speaking skills and D 82
my small nephew and D 82
my playing career and D 82
my osier farmer and D 82
my niece should not D 82
my mother cooked all D 82
my first thrashing for D 82
my father smoked and D 82
my empty bottle and D 82
my draft status was D 82
my chief person was D 82
my chief critic and D 82
my agent places that D 82
my uncle thought you D 80
my sword through its D 80
my stage career was D 80
my skull filled with D 80
my shirt collar with D 80
my shirt before going D 80
my sheep marked with D 80
my people skills and D 80
my mother potted her D 80
my knees locked and D 80
my knees before any D 80
my first painting was D 80
my first orgasm and D 80
my father quaffs with D 80
my earthly career was D 80
my dirty clothes for D 80
my chief master who D 80
my whole estate that D 49
my dirty brains out D 45
my writing career that D 44
my voice boomed out D 43

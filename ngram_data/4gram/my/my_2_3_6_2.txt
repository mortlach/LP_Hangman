my new statue of D 96
my hay should be D 96
my ears strain to D 96
my shoe caught on D 94
my pen should do D 94
my own temper to D 94
my own scraps of D 94
my own review in D 94
my own dialect of D 94
my mom forced me D 94
my long career on D 94
my head grazed the D 94
my few sticks of D 94
my ears through my D 94
my dad called my D 94
my weak embers of D 92
my two horses on D 92
my toes seemed to D 92
my tie around my D 92
my real opinion on D 92
my own theology of D 92
my own policy in D 92
my old station in D 92
my old noddle if D 92
my mom pulled me D 92
my jaw seemed to D 92
my eye firmly on D 92
my arm flamed up D 92
my eye lingered on D 91
my own troops in D 90
my own stance in D 90
my own nephew to D 90
my own horses at D 90
my own career the D 90
my old diaries to D 90
my mom treated me D 90
my mom smiled at D 90
my gig manned at D 90
my big bundle of D 90
my head tilted up D 89
my two uncles in D 88
my own flight of D 88
my old station on D 88
my old parish in D 88
my new sleigh to D 88
my gun behind the D 88
my dad bought us D 88
my bed inside the D 88
my way farther up D 87
my old haunts as D 87
my tax return on D 86
my own temper by D 86
my own psyche to D 86
my new career to D 86
my gun instead of D 86
my ears starting to D 86
my car window in D 86
my pen without my D 84
my own sphere to D 84
my one bottle of D 84
my old office to D 84
my lap before the D 84
my head shaved to D 84
my head pivoting on D 84
my hat through the D 84
my gym clothes in D 84
my going beyond sea D 84
my car window as D 84
my car filled up D 84
my being penned up D 84
my bad temper or D 84
my art avails me D 84
my pen abhors to D 82
my own pocket on D 82
my own drawings or D 82
my own drawer of D 82
my mom picked it D 82
my hat firmly on D 82
my dad pulled the D 82
my bed before he D 82
my sad opinion he D 80
my own temper or D 80
my own slaves to D 80
my own pulpit on D 80
my own packet of D 80
my own litany of D 80
my men struck me D 80
my low estate in D 80
my head shaved by D 80
my dad before me D 80
my bed placed in D 80
my art enable me D 80
my own fashion as D 61
my own pocket so D 57
my dog jumped up D 56
my own accord as D 55
my dad walked up D 50
my own office so D 49
my own tastes as D 47
my own cheeks as D 45
my head tucked in D 45
my own psyche as D 43
my head shaved so D 42
my head throbbing as D 40

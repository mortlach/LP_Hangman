myself taken from the M 198
myself after years of M 196
myself about what to M 196

mystic power over the M 170
myself never care to M 170
myself above hope or M 168
myself within view of M 164
myself ample time to M 164

myself after hearing the M 112
mystic chant over an M 110
myself might find it M 110
myself looking over at M 110
myself looking into an M 110
myself could like to M 110
myself turning from the M 108
myself shall cease to M 108
myself working hard to M 106
myself prone upon the M 106
myself often felt the M 106

myself while living in M 104
myself could have no M 104
myself again from the M 104
myself still able to M 102
myself falling down the M 102
myself thinking only of M 98
myself still more if M 98

myself growing into an M 88
myself found there is M 88
mystic meanings into the M 86
myself quite free in M 86
myself extra time to M 86
myself about what my M 86
myself writing down the M 84
myself while there is M 84

myself sitting upon the M 82
myself sitting back in M 82
myself right well in M 82
myself quite well in M 82
myself pulling into the M 82
myself where there is M 80
myself running from the M 80
myself lucky just to M 80
myself again able to M 80
myself about having to M 80
myself would like to D 4036
myself staring into the D 2898
myself would have to D 1480
myself aloof from the D 1058
myself sinking into the D 810
myself crazy trying to D 606
myself staring down at D 502
myself would have no D 408
myself would want to D 404
myself staring down the D 356
myself would wish to D 344
myself would find it D 332
myself sliding down the D 314
myself slide down the D 278
myself thrown into the D 268
myself peering into the D 260
mystic saint john of D 256
myself would have the D 250
myself would come to D 240
myself driving down the D 216
myself would love to D 212
myself would take the D 206
myself would make me D 204
myself sneaking among the D 186
myself borne down by D 184
myself would seem to D 172
myself sliding into the D 170
myself would think it D 168
myself would tend to D 164
myself spoke early in D 160
myself swept away by D 152
myself staring back at D 152
myself madly down the D 150
myself would soon be D 146
myself would give me D 138
myself swept into the D 136
myself aloof from it D 136
myself talking back to D 132
myself melting into the D 132
myself driving down to D 124
myself bound upon my D 124
myself aloof from my D 124
myself would have it D 122
myself relax into the D 122
mystic drama will be D 120
myself waist deep in D 120
myself thrown back on D 120
myself panting upon the D 120
myself sobbing into my D 114
myself mulling over the D 114
myself harking back to D 114
myself falling prey to D 114
myself growing fond of D 112
myself after leaving the D 108
myself would ever be D 106
myself plunging into the D 102
myself staring into my D 100
myself slide into the D 100
myself would take up D 98
myself driving past the D 98
myself would care to D 94
myself borne along by D 92
myself would like it D 90
myself swept along by D 90
myself staring into an D 90
myself split open in D 90
myself staring over the D 88
myself slide down to D 86
myself ankle deep in D 86
myself would make the D 82
myself driving along the D 82
myself driving into the D 80
myself delving into the D 80
myself bound also to D 80
myself borne away in D 80

my heart rose higher D 88
my foot high enough D 88
my feet like stones D 88
my eyes were peeled D 88
my eyes were firmly D 88
my sins were heavier D 86
my mare will follow D 86
my life runs darkly D 86
my legs were pinned D 86
my heart racing faster D 86
my hand some flimsy D 86
my great hemp stalks D 86
my foot from slipping D 86
my feet were bloody D 86
my breath come faster D 86
my legs went through D 85
my fist went through D 85
my wife having joined D 84
my tone from itself D 84
my shoes were almost D 84
my open door policy D 84
my mouth shut except D 84
my most loving friend D 84
my life sped amidst D 84
my legs were asleep D 84
my last ride through D 84
my last five pounds D 84
my hand from striking D 84
my good luck charms D 84
my eyes were partly D 84
my crew were killed D 84
my ants were forced D 84
my wife will attest D 82
my mind flew through D 82
my legs were dragging D 82
my ideas took another D 82
my gaze back toward D 82
my legs fall asleep D 81
my wife gets through D 80
my very soul flowed D 80
my time reading novels D 80
my soul will suffer D 80
my soul from itself D 80
my nose into another D 80
my eyes were frozen D 80
my aunt took charge D 80
my heart took fright D 55
my visa came through D 50
my mouth feel better D 49
my wife much better D 46
my hips from behind D 46
my knee felt better D 45
my teeth felt gritty D 44
my wife left behind D 42

myself should have been M 1774
myself secure from wild M 664
myself through your eyes M 620
myself through their eyes M 560
myself before your eyes M 512
myself drifting away from M 454
myself should have done M 414
myself bursting into tears M 362
myself whether there were M 290
myself fighting back tears M 274
myself wholly upon your M 204
myself should very much M 202
myself unseen into some M 182
myself without your help M 170
myself without help from M 162
myself indeed gave only M 160
myself wholly from those M 154
myself beyond their reach M 132
myself passed some time M 120
myself wholly into your M 116
mystic number much used M 114

myself before their eyes M 110
myself twenty years from M 106
mystic passes away from M 104
myself should have made M 100

myself becoming even more M 97
myself standing upon some M 96
myself should have said M 94
myself pretty wide open M 94
myself behind some logs M 92
myself whether these were M 90

myself before your very M 80
myself before your feet M 80
myself standing once more M 50
myself becoming much more M 40
myself spending more time D 879
myself slipping back into D 690
myself slipping away from D 268
myself spending less time D 114
myself blinking back tears D 100
myself goaded into saying D 94
myself farther away from D 84

my thoughts naturally turned M 892
my private telephone number M 294
my closest childhood friend M 276
my request evidently pleased M 176
my deepest gratitude belongs M 152
my thoughts sometimes wander M 142
my request contained therein M 140
my worship altogether unless M 98
my journey proceeded without M 98
my present happiness equals M 86
my natural knowledge appears M 82
my earliest childhood memory D 476
my letters sometimes convey D 360
my remaining realizable estate D 198
my private apartment behind D 156
my thoughts naturally revert D 122
my earliest childhood hidden D 98
my natural instincts recoil D 95
my present precarious stance D 84
my earliest political memory D 82

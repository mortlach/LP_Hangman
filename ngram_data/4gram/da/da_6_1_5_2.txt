dangers i lived in M 637
damage i could do M 376
damage i might do M 227
damage a piece of M 227
dangers i incur to M 186
damaging a piece of M 166
darker i began to M 120
damage i could to M 115
dawned a period of M 114
danced a dance of D 860
dampen a piece of D 586
dangled a piece of D 518
dangled a bunch of D 428
dashed a glass of D 360
darted a flash of D 304
dabbed a touch of D 226
dances a dance of D 190
dangles a bunch of D 166
darkly a period of D 142
dammed a stream to D 136
dazzling a glory on D 126
dabbed a piece of D 124
dampen a sheet of D 99
danced a waltz in D 98
dainty a piece of D 97
dashed a spray of D 92
dangers a nation is D 92
dangles a piece of D 88
dandling a child on D 84
damage i would do D 84
darted a smile at D 82
dazzling a light as D 52

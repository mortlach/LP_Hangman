source of the excited D 42
source of ad revenue D 42
soaked in the patient D 42
source of the intruding D 41
sounds in the gallery D 41
sounding in the pacific D 41
something to the puritan D 41
something to the bereaved D 41
solely to the nucleus D 41
sodium in the patient D 41
soaked up the surplus D 41
soaked in the silence D 41
source of the venetian D 40
sounds in the previous D 40
sought in the catholic D 40
something of the softening D 40
something in the sublime D 40
solely on the interior D 40
soared to the furthest D 40

song about love between M 138
son might have written M 122
son every other weekend M 116
son shall have eternal M 112
son might find himself M 112
son takes great pleasure M 104
son knelt down together M 92
son might have brought M 90
son getting into trouble M 80
son would have belonged D 202
song sinks into silence D 194
son would have brought D 152
son would find himself D 128
son would have married D 126
son would have written D 98
son would have enabled D 84
song voice came quavering D 82

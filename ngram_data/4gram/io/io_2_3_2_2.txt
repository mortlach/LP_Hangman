ion due to the D 2524
ion and of the D 2286
ion beam in the D 1474
ion out of the D 1295
ion and on the D 983
ion has to be D 954
ion and in the D 880
ion beam at the D 774
ion beam on the D 686
ion and the ion D 633
ion and to the D 612
ion beam to the D 524
ion than in the D 504
ion beam of the D 438
ion peak in the D 436
ion and it is D 398
ion and by the D 397
ion may be the D 387
ion that is the D 386
ion and is the D 347
ion beam to be D 318
ion gun to the D 276
ion path in the D 270
ion beam by the D 239
ion that is to D 236
ion beam as it D 221
ion one of the D 216
ion that it is D 205
ion are in the D 205
ion may be in D 196
ion owing to the D 187
ion was in the D 184
ion are to be D 182
ion that is in D 181
ion than to the D 181
ion goes to the D 174
ion may be an D 166
ion had to be D 157
ion and an ion D 156
ion peak of the D 147
ion than is the D 146
ion than it is D 144
ion beam at an D 141
ion was to be D 138
ion and at the D 137
ion beam is to D 132
ion beam in an D 131
ion can be in D 128
ion may be of D 124
ion and so on D 122
ion than of the D 116
ion than by the D 114
ion peak is the D 112
ion beam of an D 110
ion beam is the D 110
ion beam as the D 107
ion but it is D 104
ion are of the D 104
ion led to the D 94
ion and as the D 93
ion that is an D 92
ion beam or the D 90
ion may be so D 86
ion has on the D 84
ion and if the D 80
ion and the oh D 67
ion being in the D 63
ion this is the D 50
ion and an oh D 50
ion are at the D 46
ion than on the D 45
ion and is in D 45
ion beam or by D 42

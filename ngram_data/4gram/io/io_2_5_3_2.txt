ion reacts with the D 1370
ion rather than the D 957
ion which can be D 929
ion pairs with the D 924
ion pairs and the D 627
ion pairs can be D 559
ion which has the D 546
ion which may be D 543
ion pairs may be D 485
ion could not be D 467
ion would not be D 465
ion cores and the D 383
ion laser and the D 364
ion motion can be D 247
ion rather than to D 242
ion pumps and ion D 232
ion pairing with the D 212
ion laser with an D 207
ion would then be D 201
ion reacts with an D 196
ion would lead to D 182
ion pumps and the D 178
ion which has an D 172
ion yield and the D 168
ion laser can be D 168
ion would act as D 165
ion pairs due to D 165
ion state can be D 159
ion yield can be D 150
ion shows that the D 147
ion cloud and the D 144
ion pairs and ion D 142
ion rather than by D 141
ion laser beam is D 133
ion yield due to D 129
ion model for the D 122
ion moves out of D 118
ion traps can be D 117
ion etching can be D 115
ion pumps can be D 114
ion etching and ion D 114
ion layer and the D 112
ion pairs are the D 110
ion rather than an D 108
ion motion and the D 108
ion rather than as D 107
ion laser with the D 105
ion yield for the D 103
ion binding can be D 101
ion rather than on D 95
ion motion may be D 91
ion which has no D 88
ion binding and the D 67
ion state and the D 51
ion gauge and the D 50
ion pairing can be D 45
ion milling can be D 42

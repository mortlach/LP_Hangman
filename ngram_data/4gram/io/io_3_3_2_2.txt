ions out of the D 12592
ions are in the D 4774
ions due to the D 4152
ions and of the D 2956
ions are to be D 2254
ions and in the D 1454
ions are of the D 1316
ions and on the D 1262
ions and to the D 1172
ions and by the D 960
ions are at the D 910
ions are on the D 904
ions has to be D 833
ions and it is D 781
ions than in the D 596
ions and the ion D 545
ions owing to the D 530
ions may be the D 526
ions and so on D 382
ions had to be D 380
ions and at the D 380
ions lie in the D 371
ions are in an D 358
ions may be of D 350
ions one of the D 312
ions led to the D 312
ions than it is D 306
ions and so the D 290
ions both in the D 284
ions and is the D 280
ions act as the D 279
ions lead to the D 278
ions lie at the D 229
ions being in the D 226
ions and the oh D 219
ions act on the D 212
ions than is the D 208
ions may be in D 196
ions but it is D 192
ions than to the D 182
ions lie on the D 182
ions that it is D 172
ions can be in D 170
ions may be so D 162
ions and if the D 160
ions than do the D 158
ions going to the D 158
ions may be an D 152
ions due to an D 148
ions lying in the D 146
ions with an ion D 137
ions are by no D 134
ions with up to D 130
ions and is in D 130
ions was in the D 125
ions can be as D 124
ions end up in D 122
ions and to be D 122
ions than by the D 120
ions but in the D 118
ions act as an D 116
ions can go to D 106
ions but to the D 106
ions can be of D 104
ions can be the D 102
ions and is an D 102
ions lying on the D 100
ions lead to an D 100
ions and so is D 98
ions was of the D 96
ions and as the D 96
ions may be as D 95
ions add to the D 94
ions than of the D 92
ions act in the D 92
ions than on the D 90
ions out of it D 90
ions can be an D 86
ions but by the D 86
iota for me or D 84
ions for the ion D 50
ions with the ion D 45

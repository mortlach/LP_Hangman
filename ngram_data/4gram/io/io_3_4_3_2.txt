ions react with the D 2820
ions will not be D 1610
ions other than the D 1160
ions move out of D 1066
ions flow out of D 606
ions along with the D 529
ions move with the D 524
ions such that the D 458
ions need not be D 448
ions will then be D 414
ions will lead to D 378
ions must not be D 356
ions there are in D 327
ions pass out of D 270
ions will now be D 226
ions used for the D 215
ions show that the D 214
ions means that the D 214
ions also may be D 206
ions also act as D 200
ions coming out of D 185
ions come out of D 176
ions rush out of D 172
ions from both the D 172
ions will thus be D 158
ions will act as D 149
ions also can be D 148
ions must then be D 146
ions moving with the D 134
iota from that of D 132
ions moving out of D 132
ions vary with the D 130
ions from that of D 130
ions bind with the D 129
iota more than the D 119
ions more than the D 112
ions there may be D 108
iota must not be D 104
ions back out of D 104
ions from each of D 101
ions from all the D 100
ions turn out to D 96
ions react with an D 90
ions from one to D 88
ions other than ca D 47

ions can reach the D 486
ions that must be D 474
ions fit into the D 472
ions are those of D 418

ions all have the D 404
ions are more or D 400

ions are moving in D 354
ions has been the D 344
ions are tied up D 344

ions and will be D 324
ions that bind to D 321
ions was used to D 317
ions that leave the D 312

ions that move in D 147
ions are also in D 142
ions may bind to D 140
ions may reach the D 138

ions are used by D 133
ions and those in D 131
ions that give the D 130

ions not only in D 126
ions are moving at D 126
ions and give the D 126
ions that leads to D 124
ions out from the D 124

ions are held at D 118
ions are made by D 114
ions that make it D 112
ions may have on D 110
ions get into the D 104

ions that were in D 102
ions set free in D 102
ions and leave the D 102
ions that need to D 100
ions then bind to D 98
ions that have to D 98
ions for some of D 98
ions can pass the D 98
ions and when the D 96
ions and most of D 94
ions was used in D 90
ions are held so D 88
ions with some of D 84
ions may have the D 84
ions may even be D 84
ions with those in D 82
ions that react to D 82
ions are made in D 82
ions can have an D 80
ions are from the D 80
ions are made up D 47
ions are acting as D 45
ions that form in D 42
ions can move by D 42

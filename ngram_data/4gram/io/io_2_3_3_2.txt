ion can not be D 3579
ion beam can be D 2008
ion beam and the D 1705
ion that can be D 1120
ion and that the D 865
ion and that of D 856
ion may not be D 709
ion can then be D 638
ion can act as D 564
ion beam with the D 551
ion beam may be D 491
ion and can be D 475
ion and not the D 470
ion and for the D 460
ion beam with an D 444
ion and not to D 387
ion than for the D 384
ion that may be D 370
ion with that of D 326
ion and may be D 311
ion with one or D 304
ion and with the D 302
ion can lead to D 288
ion and one or D 277
ion beam that is D 271
ion may lead to D 255
ion that has the D 252
ion may then be D 252
ion than does the D 226
ion and one of D 207
ion and all the D 200
ion may act as D 198
ion beam due to D 196
ion and then the D 193
ion than that of D 189
ion and thus the D 189
ion can thus be D 184
ion may thus be D 162
ion can now be D 158
ion gun and the D 150
ion and has the D 140
ion and then to D 139
ion beam and to D 138
ion with all the D 137
ion with one of D 136
ion and this is D 135
ion that has an D 134
ion than with the D 131
ion but not to D 129
ion beam for the D 129
ion and not by D 124
ion peak and the D 120
ion and that it D 119
ion and each of D 118
ion and thus to D 116
ion but not the D 115
ion beam and is D 108
ion beam and an D 107
ion beam has to D 104
ion and not on D 103
ion for each of D 101
ion and use of D 100
ion and two or D 99
ion than are the D 97
ion path and the D 92
ion are due to D 92
ion was not the D 88
ion for use in D 87
ion was due to D 84
ion gun can be D 84
ion and one oh D 78
ion for all the D 41

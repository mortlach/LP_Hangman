ion must equal the D 340
ion from which it D 255
ion from which the D 229
ion pair which is D 222
ion from water to D 214
ion will again be D 180
ion were found to D 168
ion pair would be D 140
ion flow tends to D 134
ion also leaves the D 122
ion were added to D 110
ion beams could be D 108
ion pair within the D 99
ion will cause the D 96
ion must first be D 88
ion even though the D 88
ion will enter the D 84

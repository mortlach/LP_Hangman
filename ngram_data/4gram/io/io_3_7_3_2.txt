ions combine with the D 2436
ions diffuse out of D 1256
ions collide with the D 712
ions together with the D 644
ions present and the D 509
ions compete for the D 484
ions exceeds that of D 430
ions compete with the D 384

ions exchange with the D 188
ions migrate with the D 156
ions present can be D 140
ions colliding with the D 140
ions diffusing out of D 134
ions migrate out of D 122
ions suggest that the D 120
ions coupled with the D 114
ions combining with the D 108
ions present may be D 98
ions located near the D 90
ions present and on D 82
ions competing with the D 82
ions implies that the D 80
ions combine with oh D 50

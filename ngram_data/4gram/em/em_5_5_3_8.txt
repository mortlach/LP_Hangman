empty words and meaningless M 146
empty space and therefore M 140
empty rooms and passages D 318
empty halls and chambers D 285
empty words and gestures D 156
empty glass and refilled D 146
empty pride and grandeur D 124
empty rooms and hallways D 100
emery paper and polished D 95
empty lobby his presence D 94
empty towns and villages D 86
empty rooms and deserted D 41

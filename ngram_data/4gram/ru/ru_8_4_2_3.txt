ruptured into the lung D 528
ruefully down at her D 504
ruefully down at his D 412
ruptures into the lung D 248
rutabaga look on her D 180
ruptured disc in his D 156
ruefully told me that D 121
ruefully when he saw D 120
ruminant sort of way D 98
rummaged over the box D 92
ruptured disk in his D 90
rummaged among the old D 88
ruffianly side of him D 82

flowers have always been D 800
flowers were placed upon D 340
flowers were strewn upon D 333
flowers have closed their D 280
flowers born without seed D 279
flowers have already been D 272
flowers were strewn over D 237
flowers have passed away D 214
flipped over another page D 198
flashes tail through last D 192
flowers were bursting into D 182
flights have already been D 170
flowers were washed clean D 154
floated there without their D 154
flashes from lifted hand D 152
flowers have fallen from D 150
flowers have broken your D 146
flowers from summer into D 136
flatter their vanity till D 136
flowers were placed there D 128
flowers have passed their D 128
flowers will retain their D 124
florins have missed seeing D 124
flowers were strewn along D 122
flushed face turned pale D 118
flashed like sparks from D 118
flowers were blooming there D 117
flowers have turned into D 112
flowers have changed their D 112
floated what looked like D 108
flowers were blooming over D 102
flowers look something like D 100
floated over anchor lane D 100
floated their trains along D 98
flashed back twenty years D 94
flowers were always kept D 90
flocked roving whites from D 90
flights from reality into D 86
flopped down across from D 84
flowers were blooming along D 82
flavoring your cosmic stew D 82
flashes like sparks from D 56

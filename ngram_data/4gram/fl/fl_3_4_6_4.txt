fly into pieces when M 152
fly into another rage M 143
fly away without saying M 116
fly over another gate M 100
fly like thought from M 96
fly there direct from M 45
fly other ravening fowl D 304
fly their arrows upon D 220
fly over rivers like D 156
fly like sparks from D 127
fly their arrows from D 104
fly their planes into D 96
fling their weapons down D 95
fly their arrows among D 94
fling some scraps over D 88
fling your spirit into D 82
fling their lovely arms D 82

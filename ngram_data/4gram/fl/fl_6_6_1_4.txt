flames before i give M 320
fleeting moment i felt M 308
fluids through a well M 126
flames reached a great M 122
flipping through a book D 1068
flowed through a deep D 986
flipping through a copy D 660
flowed through a wide D 466
flight became a rout D 306
flower without a stem D 304
flicking through a book D 284
flipping through a pile D 260
flicking through a copy D 254
fluids through a tube D 247
flowed through a pipe D 244
flowed through a wire D 242
flowed through a void D 200
flipping through a file D 199
flowed through a land D 188
flowed through a tube D 186
flower becoming a seed D 178
flowed through a vast D 162
flowed through a part D 162
flocks around a dumb D 162
fluids through a pipe D 160
flicking through a pile D 152
floating through a dream D 142
flipping through a sheaf D 134
flower without a root D 130
flowed through a single D 130
flowed through a great D 124
flowed through a hole D 122
flowed through a rich D 120
flipping through a thick D 120
fluids through a vein D 115
flowed without a break D 110
flipping through a rack D 108
flower assuming a more D 107
florid carpet a gilt D 106
flower without a name D 98
flowed through a lake D 92
flight without a word D 92
flowed through a very D 90
floating through a dark D 88
flipping through a card D 88
flowed through a wild D 86
floating across a blue D 86
flight without a blow D 82
flitting through a town D 80
flight without a single D 80

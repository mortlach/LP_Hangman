fluttering like a wounded D 386
fluttering like a trapped D 335
flinched when i touched D 186
fluttering like a captive D 159
fluttering from a hummock D 156
flourish like a brigand D 130
fluttering over a cluster D 118
flagella from a variety D 116
flowered from a selfish D 98
fluttering like a pennant D 88
flutters like a trapped D 45

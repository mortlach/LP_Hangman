didst debase thyself even D 348
didst betray before dawn D 146
dimly loomed through like D 136
dialed another number from D 134
digit random number from D 130
digging myself deeper into D 112
dirty clothes standing next D 108
dirty little secret from D 102
dirty little coward shot D 96
diadem itself should steal D 80

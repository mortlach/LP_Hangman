did come across a M 2196
did what little i M 1288
did leave behind a M 1224
did pass through a M 870
did nothing without a M 828
did there emerge a M 734
did there remain a M 372
did just before i M 358
did work whither i M 274
did ever record a M 242
did just before a M 238
did move toward a M 228
did fall asleep i M 220
did time permit i M 196
die away without a M 190
did have something i M 178
die down before i M 172
die away before a M 156
did those without a M 154
did even before i M 146
dim eyes caught a M 142
did push through a M 138
did seem something a M 123
did know whether i M 120
did come through a M 120
did move around a M 112
did well without a M 106
die here before i M 96
did find something i M 88
did find myself a M 88
did make myself a M 86
did know before i M 86
did ever refuse a M 86
did know something i M 84
did give myself a M 84
did what seemed a M 82
did seem almost a M 80
did when entering a D 126
dig down through a D 98
did tend toward a D 94
did upon entering a D 80

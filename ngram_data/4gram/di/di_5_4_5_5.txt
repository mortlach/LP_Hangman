dizzy just thinking about D 496
diced into small cubes D 359
dipping into boiling water D 242
didst call first chaos D 234
dined there every night D 148
dirty cloth bound round D 132
dimly their gliding forms D 128
disks free nerve endings D 96
dirty lamp every evening D 86
diets have lower rates D 86
ditto from white warps D 82

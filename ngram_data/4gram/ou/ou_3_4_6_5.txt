our poor little darling D 80
our most superb trees D 80
our most severe social D 80
our mere senses could D 80
our main fighting fleet D 80
out into violent weeping D 57
out into various kinds D 49
out from nuclear testing D 49
our most recent thinking D 47
out your career goals D 45
out from behind steel D 42
out their public roles D 41
out their career plans D 41
out three places where D 40
out like cotton candy D 40
out into freezing weather D 40
out from weapons testing D 40
our more recent thinking D 40

out through the foam D 41
out behind the canoe D 41
out behind the bush D 41
out before it sank D 41
our stores of wheat D 41
our findings on what D 41
out through the vine D 40
out through the pack D 40
out through the mess D 40
out beyond the park D 40
out before the feast D 40
our stores of gold D 40
our armies so much D 40

burgeoning role in the D 84
buoyant step to the D 84
buoyant step of the D 84
bungalow early in the D 84
bullets were on the D 84
bullets fell on my D 84
bugaboo went at it D 84
buckles were of the D 84
buckets fell to the D 84
buckets down at the D 84
bullock cart or the D 83
buckets used to be D 83
bunkers deep in the D 82
bullets coming at me D 82
buffalo park in the D 82
bubbles clinging to it D 82
bubbled over on the D 82
bubbled forth at the D 82
busiest week of my D 80
buoyant faith of the D 80
bullets tore at the D 80
bullets told on the D 80
buffalo gnat of the D 80
buckled part of the D 58
burrowing owls in the D 50
buffalo hunt by the D 48
burrowing wolf of the D 46
burrowing into the sea D 42
bulldog ants of the D 42
buffalo chip on the D 42
buffalo hunt at the D 41
buffalo heads on the D 41
budgeting have to be D 40
buckets down in the D 40

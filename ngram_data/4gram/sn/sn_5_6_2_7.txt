snaps instead of buttons D 464
snaking through the streets D 242
sneaking through the streets D 134
snake before it strikes D 124
snake through the streets D 120
sneaking around the corners D 100
sneer curled the corners D 92
snake across the country D 92
snake across the surface D 86
snaking through my thoughts D 84

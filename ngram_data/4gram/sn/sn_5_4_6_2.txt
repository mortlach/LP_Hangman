snoring loud enough to D 840
snake lies rolled in D 484
snore came through the D 354
snore loud enough to D 272
sneaking along through the D 255
snake just behind the D 216
snake coil itself up D 206
snowy peaks called the D 198
sneaking back through the D 174
snowy jets gushed up D 170
snaking down through the D 165
snows have melted in D 164
snake fears except me D 162
snake bite should be D 154
snake down through the D 150
snake moving through the D 148
snake lies hidden in D 138
snout came dripping up D 136
snows have melted on D 126
snake slid across the D 126
snort like whales in D 120
snake lies coiled in D 112
sniping from behind the D 110
sneaking back across the D 108
snows have driven the D 106
snows will suffer me D 104
sneaking away through the D 102
snake moving across the D 100
snake bore something in D 100
sniff from behind the D 98
sniping from across the D 94
snowy range through the D 90
snowy peaks seemed to D 86
snaking back through the D 86
snack bars around the D 86

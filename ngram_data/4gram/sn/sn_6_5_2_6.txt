snapping under the weight D 308
snapping under the strain D 308
snakes about to strike D 187
snares which the simple D 186
snarling hails of melody D 164
sneering voice as archer D 162
snugly under the covers D 150
snapping short the glassy D 136
snowed under or turned D 126
sneaked round the corner D 120
snakes spend the winter D 102

snow stopped falling and M 550
snow happily shall not M 146
snow started falling and M 114
snow covered hills and M 80
snow crunching under his D 422
snow crunching under our D 280
snow crunching beneath his D 192
snug country boxes with D 174
snow crunching under her D 136
snow squeaked under his D 134
snow squeaked under our D 116
snow crunching beneath her D 114
snow squeaked under her D 102
snow swirled about them D 88
snow crunching beneath our D 88
snug harbors where they D 82
snow swirled about her D 80

snowed the night before D 1316
snakes on rolling spires D 220
snatch at every chance D 144
snuffing the fresh breeze D 134
sniffing in every corner D 122
sneeze or cough without D 111
sniffing the white powder D 102
snakes or hissing adders D 102
snatch thy first kisses D 100
snouts of others peeped D 94
sniffing the grape shoots D 92
snugly in place behind D 84
snacks the night before D 45

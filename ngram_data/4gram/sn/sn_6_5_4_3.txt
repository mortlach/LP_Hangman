snapping black eyes and D 999
sneering smile upon his D 176
snapping brown eyes and D 172
snugly piled away for D 136
snakes would come out D 129
snapping black eyes that D 120
snares which hell and D 114
snares which were set D 112
snappy black eyes and D 110
snakes growing from his D 110
snugly seated upon his D 106
snakes would come and D 94
snarling irony left him D 90

snatched away before the D 450
snuggled even closer to D 402
snatched away before my D 266
snatched mine through the D 246
snatched away before it D 202
snatched from rivers of D 162
snuggled down beside me D 142
snatched from fields of D 120
snowshoes were greater by D 114
sneeringly asks whether we D 108
snickers from behind the D 90
snuggled down deeper in D 88
snuggled down behind the D 44

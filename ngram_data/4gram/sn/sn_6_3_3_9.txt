snuffing out her cigarette D 174
snakes that are poisonous D 174
snuffs out his cigarette D 146
snubbing way had irritated D 104
sneering foes and astounded D 102
snares for that guileless D 98
snapping his head backwards D 91
snacks that are nutritious D 90
snarling that was desperate D 84

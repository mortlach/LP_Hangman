humble myself under your M 174
humble client whose case M 154

hurled headlong flaming from D 1737
hurrying through grass from D 170
humane person would wish D 170
hurtling through space some D 160
humane person would have D 148
humble saloon would have D 84
humane actions ought well D 82
hurtling through space like D 80

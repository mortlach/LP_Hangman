aorta can not be D 918
aorta may lead to D 506
aorta and may be D 422
aorta and then to D 320
aorta may not be D 253
aorta and can be D 248
aorta and out to D 203
aorta can then be D 185
aorta and with the D 182
aorta and all the D 182
aorta and that of D 174
aorta and one of D 158
aorta but not in D 156
aorta and lead to D 140
aorta and then the D 136
aorta can lead to D 131
aorta and that the D 130
aorta and that in D 124
aorta that can be D 123
aorta are due to D 116
aorta that may be D 102
aorta and not to D 88
aorta and thus to D 86
aorta and near the D 86
aorta may then be D 84
aorta and goes to D 84
aorta but not the D 80
aorta can now be D 45
aorta may thus be D 41

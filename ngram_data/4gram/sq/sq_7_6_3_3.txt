squared errors for each M 246
squared values for each M 199
squared errors for all M 130
squared values for all M 125
squared errors for this M 125
squared itself with its M 94
squalid peasant all that D 320
squared loadings for each D 221
squinting fellow who sat D 208
squinting through one eye D 136
squared scores for each D 127
squeeze through and get D 126

squatting beside him and D 116

squinting toward our own D 94
squalid misery that was D 90

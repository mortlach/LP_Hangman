zen comes from the M 142
zen monks such as M 42
zeal which knew no D 360
zeal boils over in D 232
zeal which made the D 228
zeal shall make no D 208
zeal which leads to D 162
zeal which some of D 146
zeal arising from the D 124
zeal working upon the D 123
zeal would burn in D 118
zeal which many of D 112
zeal which must be D 108
zeal burst forth in D 104
zeal could have no D 100
zeal swept over the D 98
zeal which made it D 94
zen would seem to D 88
zeal which gave the D 88
zeal might also be D 82

her long skirt swirling D 80
her long scarf caught D 80
her age would invent D 80
heat and thirst forced D 80
hear his riven chains D 80
head was getting bigger D 80
her long white dressing D 73
her new black patent D 50
hear that clock strike D 44
hear low tones better D 43
head was rolling around D 43
her toes every minute D 42
her car after shopping D 41

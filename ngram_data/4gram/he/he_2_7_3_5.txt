he crawled and crept D 80
he coughed and asked D 80
he charged with anything D 80
he carries his staff D 80
he carries his crops D 80
he carried two spears D 80
he brought his cheek D 80
he assigns him money D 80
he arranged his cards D 80
he admired his skill D 80
he twirled her round D 63
he removed his glass D 56
he ravaged and burnt D 56
he abjures his magic D 56
he removed his steel D 55
he slapped her right D 52
he visited his grave D 51
he brought his chief D 50
he whirled thee round D 49
he watched his chief D 46
he regards with scorn D 46
he related with gusto D 45
he haunted her grave D 45
he watched her stoop D 44
he watched her stomp D 44
he relates with gusto D 44
he watches her dance D 43
he watched her strip D 43
he flashes his light D 43
he allowed his chief D 43
he watched her sweep D 42
he stocked his sheep D 42
he shrieks and cries D 42
he realizes how badly D 42
he chopped and sawed D 42
he worries and frets D 41
he snapped his snuff D 41
he listens and talks D 41
he himself has drunk D 41
he devotes his working D 41
he assigns his right D 41
he watched her flush D 40
he smoothed her skirt D 40
he nestled her close D 40
he dressed and armed D 40
he carried his snuff D 40

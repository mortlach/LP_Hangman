he jumped just like D 80
he jotted down during D 80
he gently drew back D 80
he gained some cheap D 80
he bumped into other D 80
he avowed once more D 80
he always wears those D 80
he derive from such D 73
he plunged into such D 70
he should roll over D 68
he struck once more D 62
he prized even more D 57
he plunged into more D 56
he drinks even more D 55
he beheld from afar D 54
he should hold firm D 53
he shrunk from such D 50
he loathed even more D 50
he roared once more D 48
he reveals even more D 48
he became more firm D 48
he always paid back D 48
he gently drew down D 47
he changed into gold D 47
he reveals much more D 46
he should throw open D 44
he should ride down D 44
he should ride along D 44
he minded nothing else D 44
he sailed back down D 43
he lapsed into such D 43
he became more loving D 42
he glared once more D 41
he struck back hard D 40
he shrank from hearing D 40
he merely took hold D 40
he hopped back over D 40
he fairly flew along D 40

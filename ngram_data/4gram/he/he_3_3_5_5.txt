hear her hearty laugh D 80
head with shaking hands D 80
head was nodding again D 80
head and limbs fixed D 80
head and flowing white D 80
head and thorax white D 77
heat and fluid flows D 59
heat and burning thirst D 57
her long flowing locks D 54
head and stood stock D 53
her thin shawl round D 51
heat and water flows D 50
her own place setting D 46
hear them talking below D 46
heat and rapid cooling D 44
her own looking glass D 41
her and every nerve D 41

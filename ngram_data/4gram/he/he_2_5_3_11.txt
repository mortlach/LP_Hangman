he loves you passionately D 82
he found him obstinately D 82
he fired his blunderbuss D 82
he dined with ambassadors D 82
he would not countersign D 80
he makes his subterranean D 80
he loved too passionately D 80
he fixed his unfathomable D 80
he began with experiments D 80
he began his professorial D 80
he asked for missionaries D 80
he pleads for understanding D 48

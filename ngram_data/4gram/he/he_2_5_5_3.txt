he kills eight fat D 82
he keeps wasting his D 82
he keeping tryst with D 82
he hoped would let D 82
he grows dizzy with D 82
he gives feasts and D 82
he flies round and D 82
he flies rather than D 82
he falls beneath his D 82
he drove round and D 82
he could untie his D 82
he could twist off D 82
he could strut his D 82
he could slice off D 82
he could shine with D 82
he could rival any D 82
he could relax was D 82
he could probe his D 82
he could float with D 82
he could fancy him D 82
he could endow them D 82
he could drink off D 82
he could charm with D 82
he could breast its D 82
he yawns again and D 80
he would whisk his D 80
he would waver and D 80
he would trade him D 80
he would spare our D 80
he would quake with D 80
he would plunge him D 80
he would nudge him D 80
he would lodge that D 80
he would knock all D 80
he would haste out D 80
he would enter him D 80
he would drive our D 80
he would count her D 80
he would climb with D 80
he would change our D 80
he would block that D 80
he would bleed his D 80
he would blast his D 80
he tried shaking his D 80
he toyed again with D 80
he talking about all D 80
he stood patting his D 80
he still shone with D 80
he still faces this D 80
he sells goods and D 80
he roams about with D 80
he reared above her D 80
he rather would not D 80
he opens doors and D 80
he never quite hit D 80
he never loved thee D 80
he never knits his D 80
he never bites his D 80
he nearly drove them D 80
he might usurp his D 80
he might study art D 80
he loved fresh air D 80
he loved driving his D 80
he loped after her D 80
he liked farming and D 80
he holds court with D 80
he found dirty and D 80
he falls short and D 80
he could taste but D 80
he could sniff them D 80
he could really dig D 80
he could rally all D 80
he could easily hop D 80
he could annex them D 80
he began rubbing them D 80
he again plays with D 80
he added slyly that D 80
he would later dub D 72
he would bound out D 72
he would either cut D 64
he could score off D 57
he would sheer off D 56
he would either set D 55
he would stand pat D 50
he would never head D 50
he would smash that D 49
he lacks anything that D 49
he again leaned out D 48
he would float out D 47
he would quote that D 46
he still lacks that D 46
he would print out D 45
he would press that D 45
he would plunge out D 45
he speaks about one D 45
he would spare that D 44
he would match thee D 43
he would cover that D 43
he speaks right out D 43
he might flunk out D 43
he might drink out D 43
he would stand that D 42
he would rather bid D 42
he would alter that D 42
he would weigh two D 41
he would reveal one D 41
he would often bear D 41
he would never fee D 41
he would forgo that D 41
he would cover one D 41
he hired every oil D 41
he first spoke that D 41
he blows smoke out D 41
he would sleep long D 40
he would glide out D 40
he would force one D 40
he would exult that D 40
he shall visit thee D 40
he notes wryly that D 40
he could gouge out D 40

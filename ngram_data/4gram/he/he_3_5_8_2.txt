her pulse quickening in D 88
her knees alongside the D 88
her hands tightening in D 88
her first communion by D 88
her father bequeathed to D 88
her books clutched to D 88
hear every syllable he D 88
her brain conjured up D 87
her whole armament on D 86
her novel approach to D 86
her hands listless in D 86
her front flippers to D 86
her father invested in D 86
her father glowered at D 86
her earnings acquired by D 86
her dowry included the D 86
her blush deepened to D 86
her would therefore be D 84
her white employer as D 84
her throne depended on D 84
her strong critique of D 84
her small reserves of D 84
her scant wardrobe in D 84
her mother bestowed on D 84
her minor children or D 84
her hands scrabbling at D 84
her dress sparkled in D 84
her court returned to D 84
hen would continue to D 84
heat sinks attached to D 84
head nodding slightly as D 84
head leaned slightly to D 84
her world exploded in D 82
her works delights in D 82
her voice thickened as D 82
her voice shattering the D 82
her voice dwindled as D 82
her thighs trembled as D 82
her smile softened the D 82
her sails concealed by D 82
her rapid progress to D 82
her niece returned to D 82
her mother sprawled on D 82
her lover intended to D 82
her hands entangled in D 82
her first rehearsal in D 82
her fingers remained in D 82
her father entreated me D 82
her crude attempts at D 82
her throat thickened as D 81
her which amounted to D 80
her mother murmured in D 80
her final semester in D 80
her father lavished on D 80
her faint whispers of D 80
her dirty underwear in D 80
her beauty excelled by D 80
heat which converts it D 80
head rolling groggily on D 80
heat after exposure to D 46
her chair sideways so D 43
her dress buttoned up D 41
her fingers quivered as D 40

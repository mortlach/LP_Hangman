feel the lump that D 45
feed on skin and D 45
feed the seals and D 44
feed of fuel and D 44
felt the tingle that D 43
felt the lump that D 42
feel the sweat bead D 42
feast on more than D 42
fell on their bed D 41
feed on beans and D 41
feast on wine and D 41
felt the stir that D 40
feast on food and D 40

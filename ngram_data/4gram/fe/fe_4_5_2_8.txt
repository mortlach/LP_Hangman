fell under the romantic D 84
feet apart to indicate D 84
feel would be reserved D 84
feel bound to denounce D 84
feet above the cylinder D 83
felt would be accepted D 82
felt bound to register D 82
felt below the clavicle D 82
fell short of indicating D 82
feet below the formation D 82
fees would be returned D 82
feel would be adequate D 82
fears would be assuaged D 82
felt under the blankets D 80
felt bound to restrict D 80
fell within the sixteenth D 80
fell within the economic D 80
fell short of conferring D 80
fell within the reserved D 48
fell under the conquering D 46
fell short of standard D 46
felt above the prostate D 45
feel touch or pressure D 42
feet under my clattering D 41
feet stuck in concrete D 41

feel severe pains in D 94
felt myself staring at D 92
felt itself bound in D 92
fell famine marks the D 92
fell asleep talking to D 92
feast waited while the D 92
felt another pulse of D 90
felt almost faint as D 90
felt almost drunk on D 90
felt sudden pains in D 88
fell headlong under the D 88
feel myself bound at D 88
feed molten metal to D 88
fern without burnt as D 86
felt myself bound as D 86
feet firmly resting on D 86
felt tension begin to D 82
felt someone nudge me D 82
felt another flare of D 82
feel itself bound as D 80
felt myself tense up D 69
felt chills running up D 59
felt bodily sense of D 54
feel myself choking up D 45
feel myself welling up D 42
feel warmly about the D 40
feel chills running up D 40

gnashed upon me with D 742
gnarled like an old D 327
gnarled hand on his D 236
gnarled hand on her D 226
gnarled hand to his D 200
gnarled finger at her D 180
gnarled hand to her D 176
gnarled finger at him D 170
gnarled hand up and D 130
gnarled hand in his D 122
gnarled face as she D 106
gnarled like an oak D 96
gnarled finger to her D 84

have been in pitch D 41
hard work of packing D 41
hard into the waves D 41
hard into my palms D 41
hanging over the swamp D 41
hand over the takings D 41
hand over the skull D 41
hand over the dirty D 41
half sunk in water D 41
half mile of cable D 41
have seen the split D 40
have seen the camel D 40
have seen the breach D 40
have pain or itching D 40
have heard of roman D 40
have been to ascot D 40
have been the strap D 40
have been the mongol D 40
have been the clown D 40
have been no driving D 40
have been as chary D 40
have been an aural D 40
hard into the metal D 40
hand over my shirt D 40
hand full of sugar D 40
hand from the pilot D 40
half inch to spare D 40
hair over the pubes D 40

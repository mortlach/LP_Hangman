operation that requires a M 1384
operation that produces a M 916
operation that involves a M 458
operation and provides a M 428
operation and requires a M 392
operation that required a M 372
operation that provides a M 368
operation has produced a M 298
operator that produces a M 286
operation that includes a M 282
operator that performs a M 276
operation that included a M 210
operation and produces a M 210
operation was declared a M 190
operation that involved a M 186
operator who receives a M 168
operation and provided a M 168
operation and therefore a M 164
operation that combines a M 144
operation has provided a M 144
operation and produced a M 142
operator that provides a M 138
operation that performs a M 138
operator has received a M 136
operator has obtained a M 136
operation was therefore a M 134
operation was actually a M 132
operator has acquired a M 130
operation and maintain a M 128
operator can maintain a M 120
operation was finished i M 120
operator has selected a M 114
operation had produced a M 114
operation has effected a M 112
operation that replaces a M 110
operation that produced a M 110
operation was probably a M 106
operator who operates a M 104
operation that modifies a M 100
operation has received a M 100
operation and includes a M 94
operation and preserving a M 90
operator who performs a M 88
operation and involves a M 86
operation and obtained a M 82
operands and produces a D 332
operation that converts a D 282
operator that converts a D 188
opposite was anchored a D 122
operation for delivering a D 92
operation was obviously a D 82

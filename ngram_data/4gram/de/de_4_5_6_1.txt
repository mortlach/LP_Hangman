deep breaths before i M 504
deep within myself i M 492
deep water without a M 272
deep cutting through a M 248
deep water through a M 144
deep within myself a M 133
debt could become a M 114
debt shall become a M 104
deck again without a D 206
debt would become a D 194
deep gorge through a D 140
deep abyss whence i D 132
desk sorting through a D 130
deer running through a D 106
desk thumbing through a D 98
desk looking through a D 41

anger burn against your M 360
anger gain control over M 280
anger more acutely felt M 128
angel will descend from M 118
angry these seventy years M 110
anew into position there M 82
angry tears streamed down M 42
ants soon swarmed over D 170
anon their bemused wits D 164
anon these dormant buds D 142
ants were removed from D 100

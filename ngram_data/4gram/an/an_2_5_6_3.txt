an ethnic cleansing that D 81
an opera troupe and D 80
an opening session with D 80
an opening section for D 80
an olive colour and D 80
an obese person are D 80
an ivory blouse and D 80
an inert liquid and D 80
an enemy elated with D 80
an empty bottle near D 80
an earthly knight they D 80
an awful thought hit D 80
an attic window with D 80
an arrow diagram can D 80
an armed driver and D 80
an apple dumpling and D 80
an ample dinner was D 80
an added outlet for D 80
an arrow pointing east D 77
an atrial escape beat D 74
an elite status that D 65
an evening ritual that D 56
an extra session that D 54
an inner vacuum that D 47
an argon pumped dye D 47
an extra dollar that D 46
an empty parade that D 46
an adult status that D 46
an older cousin that D 45
an orange fright wig D 44
an earnings report that D 43
an added insult that D 42
an adoring public that D 40

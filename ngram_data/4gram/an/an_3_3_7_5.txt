and was cynical about M 172
and two upright posts M 172
and two thousand pages M 172
and things started looking M 172
and they started speaking M 172
and they shouted aloud M 172
and then several small M 172
and then rotated until M 172
and then quickly looks M 172
and then dropped until M 172
and then altered again M 172
and that violence might M 172

and then married women M 168
and then everything could M 168
and then emptied again M 168
and then decides where M 168
and that usually works M 168
and that perhaps under M 168
and that fraction which M 168
and that certain tasks M 168
and that capital which M 168
and she stopped still M 168
and she laughed often M 168

an idyll and the D 84
an idler and an D 84
an iambic poem of D 84
an exact tie in D 84
an etching that he D 84
an epoch that no D 84
an enemy spy or D 84
an empty tub or D 84
an empty pew on D 84
an edict not to D 84
an aviary near the D 84
an ashen tinge as D 84
an anthem set to D 84
an anthem may be D 84
an ample pot of D 84
an alpha ray or D 84
an abbot was to D 84
an unreal one in D 82
an otter was the D 82
an organ and we D 82
an opiate can be D 82
an older guy he D 82
an oasis for my D 82
an igloo with an D 82
an house for thy D 82
an hotel can be D 82
an extra gun on D 82
an epoch but an D 82
an empty car of D 82
an arrow are the D 82
an apple off my D 82
an anthem with the D 82
an alloy and an D 82
an alarm ringing in D 82
an uncle and to D 80
an uncle and in D 80
an overt aim of D 80
an organ and he D 80
an opera aria or D 80
an index for me D 80
an extra nip of D 80
an epoch near to D 80
an eland and an D 80
an arrow hit it D 80
an aroma that the D 80
an anthem for an D 80
an added sting in D 80
an adagio and the D 80
an entry fee as D 49
an earthen pot so D 45
an urban set up D 41

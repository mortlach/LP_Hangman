voice raised against these M 282
voice loudly accused many M 190
voice barely carried over M 157
voice always sounded like M 144
voice sounds exactly like M 132
voice spreads heavenly peace M 92
voice hardly sounded like M 88
voice almost sounded like M 82
voice barely audible over D 1146
voice varied rapidly from D 858
vowed revenge against those D 232
voice barely audible even D 153
voice became audible once D 122
voice called sharply from D 118
voice called faintly from D 104
voice sounding shrilly from D 86

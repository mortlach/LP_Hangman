pope gladly gave it D 84
poor voters from the D 84
poor report card or D 84
poor nations trying to D 84
poor little chap in D 84
poor feller like me D 84
poor blacks during the D 84
poems carved into the D 84
pour brandy over the D 82
post office uses the D 82
pope should keep in D 82
poor turkey shot to D 82
pole pieces from the D 82
pour petrol over it D 80
pour floods upon the D 80
post office gave me D 80
posing another threat to D 80
poor peasant will be D 80
poor peasant like the D 80
poor orphan from the D 80
poor marble must be D 80
pole figure from the D 77
post office wall in D 49
pole flashing past the D 44
post office site in D 41
pore eagerly over the D 40
polo player from the D 40
poke around some of D 40

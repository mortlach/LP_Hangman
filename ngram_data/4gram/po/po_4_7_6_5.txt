poor quality ground water M 196
poor creature indeed whose M 108
poems written before jumping M 71
pour himself another drink D 1878
pour himself another glass D 756
pour herself another drink D 390
pour herself another glass D 362
poor quality drinking water D 190
poor ancient pistol swore D 168
pour remaining tomato sauce D 157
poor comrade showed signs D 154
poor manager shouting still D 96
pour freshly boiled water D 82

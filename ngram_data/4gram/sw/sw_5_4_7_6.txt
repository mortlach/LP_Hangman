swept away everything before D 262
sweet home baptist church D 181
sweet soul darkens through D 164
swept into certain actions D 156
swift fury blindly darted D 134
swain kill fifteen whales D 134
sword were carried through D 128
sweep along shivery angular D 128
swears like several fiends D 98
swift step towards temple D 96
swept away several houses D 94
swell their courage beyond D 49

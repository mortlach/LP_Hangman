sweetness flows into the D 934
sweetness comes from the D 358
swallowed every word of D 338
swallowed about half the D 290
swallowed every drop of D 288
swallowed theirs upon the D 254
swallowed blood from the D 204
swallowed whole have the D 200
swallowed whole into the D 199
swallowed about half of D 180
sweetness would make us D 136
sweetness palls upon the D 128
swaggered about among the D 100
sweetness which made the D 90
sweetness arising from the D 90
sweetened every hour of D 90
sweetened foods such as D 89
swallowed every word he D 88
swallowed every pill in D 88
sweetness which there is D 86

swore violently under his M 326
swore viciously under his M 238
swore silently under his M 112
swore horribly under his M 80
sweating sickness broke out D 417
sword concealed under his D 341
swift physical decay that D 324
sweet melodious sound that D 324
swore savagely under his D 270
sweet collision mingled with D 252
sweet courtesy which was D 242
swaying unevenly hither and D 170
sword concealed beneath his D 140
swore bitterly under his D 136
sweet childish voice rang D 136
swaying branches above them D 120
sweating sickness which was D 96
swede suddenly risen and D 92
sweet twilight walks and D 87
sweet refreshing thirst for D 84
sweet friendly women and D 82

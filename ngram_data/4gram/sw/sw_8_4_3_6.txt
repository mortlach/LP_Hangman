sweetest songs yet remain D 360
switched from one object D 218
swallowing their own saliva D 164
sweetest dream that labour D 151
switched from one camera D 146
switched from one system D 130
switched from one station D 126
swallowing gold and silver D 126
switches from one stable D 125
switches from one camera D 122
switched from one stable D 120
swallowing bread and cheese D 116
switched from his earlier D 114
swaggering talk and manner D 104
sweltering days and nights D 102
swastika flag was raised D 100
switched gears and became D 92
switched from one person D 92
switched from one target D 90
swallowing hard and blinking D 90
switched from one sector D 80
swallows gold and spouts D 71
switches from one regime D 61

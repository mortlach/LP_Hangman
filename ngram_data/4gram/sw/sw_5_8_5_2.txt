swims actively about in M 118
sweet intimate musings as M 90
sweet aspersion shall the D 974
sweep problems under the D 618
sweet entrancing voice he D 348
swift instinct threads the D 216
sweet melodious birds be D 198
swift downward swoop of D 190
swift daylight kills it D 152
sweet pastimes grace my D 146
swarm mightily about the D 138
sweet communion which is D 136
swaying slightly under the D 124
sweet whispering tones of D 114
swift recovery after the D 112
swift military action to D 104
swore solemnly never to D 100
swift downward sweep of D 92
sweet metallic taste in D 92
sweating sickness raged in D 86
swore personal fealty to D 80
swift progress under my D 80
swearing fidelity round the D 80

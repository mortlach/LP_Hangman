sway and influence over D 219
swinging head downwards from D 176
swam and glimmered like D 170
swinging his ponderous legs D 120
sway she exercised over D 117
swung his explosive whip D 110
swung its noiseless bell D 90
swung his briefcase onto D 90
swinging its clamorous iron D 84
sway and influence upon D 84
sweat and exhausted from D 46

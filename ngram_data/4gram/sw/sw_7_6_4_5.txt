swiftly strode from ridge D 476
swiftly fleets back again D 254
swollen beyond their usual D 132
swiftly through your amber D 132
sweetly chants such maids D 116
swiftly through their veins D 110
swollen beyond their banks D 102
swerved across three lanes D 100
swollen clouds from raining D 94
swirled around their knees D 84

swollen from every side D 294
switching from whole milk D 230
swallow very large prey D 230
switching their focus from D 100
sweeter when cares come D 100
swarmed like flies over D 98
swiftly over rocky beds D 94
swallow such large prey D 94
swollen face close over D 90
swollen from melting snow D 86
swooped down again upon D 53

swung him around until M 90
swung her around twice M 86
swung her around while M 82

swinging and rattling about D 202
swan and whooping crane D 188
swung his mighty sword D 172
swinging her around until D 114

swam and played about D 102
swung his steering wheel D 98
sweat and throbbing veins D 92
swim and splash about D 90
swung her swivel chair D 88
sway and totter about D 86
sweat had formed under D 82

sweetness caused me by D 396
sweetness before it is D 374
swallowed before it is D 308
swordfish stocks in the D 280
swallowed enough of the D 272
sweetness seemed to be D 176
swallowed poison as if D 176
swallowed bodily by the D 148
swallowed poison in the D 146
sweetness welled up in D 128
swallowed object in the D 126
swordfish caught in the D 121
sweetened version of the D 120
sweetener market in the D 116
sweetened coffee or tea D 115
sweetness wasted on the D 111
swallowed enough of it D 104
swallowed eagerly by the D 100
swallowed pounds of it D 88
swaggered around in the D 85
swallowed knives to the D 80

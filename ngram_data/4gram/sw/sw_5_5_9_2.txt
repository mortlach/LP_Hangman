sweet brood throughout the M 110
sweet child interests me M 88
swamp which separates it D 349
sword would sometimes be D 300
sword dance performed by D 240
sweet nothings whispered in D 178
swore undying allegiance to D 166
sweet herbs refreshed me D 110
sword alike compelled the D 106
sweet taste gratifies the D 102
sweet juice extracted in D 92
sweet voice whispered in D 90
sword which inflicted the D 88
sword which glittered in D 80

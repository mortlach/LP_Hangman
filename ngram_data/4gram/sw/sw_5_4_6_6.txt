sweet face shaped itself M 140
sworn into united states M 120
sweet their praise divine M 104
sweet girl looked pleased M 92
sweet face turned toward M 86
sword will pierce through D 1312
sworn into office before D 590
swift lord through ruined D 518
swift their various motions D 362
swept over without ruffling D 230
sweep these lovely plains D 183
sweet fire sweeps across D 144
swept away before another D 110
sweep those lovely plains D 104
sweep their wooden bridge D 100
sworn into office without D 98
swept away almost without D 92

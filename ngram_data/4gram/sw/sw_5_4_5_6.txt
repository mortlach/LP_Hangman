sweet time getting around M 113
sweet thief which sourly D 674
sword will never depart D 576
swept like chaff before D 268
sword three times through D 199
sword went right through D 154
sword only could decide D 150
swift fire spread through D 121
swirl your tongue around D 118
sword were borne before D 116
swift will never cleanse D 116
sword were running through D 108
sweep your fingers through D 108
sword must first retreat D 104
swept away whole tribes D 100
sweep away every refuge D 99
sword went quite through D 92
swarm like flies around D 87
sweet eyes shining through D 84
swept away every building D 81
sweep over large tracts D 49

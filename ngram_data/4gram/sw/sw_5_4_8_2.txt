sweet breath composed as M 384
sweet girl welcomed me M 226
sweet young presence in M 104
sweet young daughter of M 100

swept away hundreds of D 684
sweep away thousands of D 343
swell when immersed in D 315
sweep away entirely the D 314
swept away entirely by D 292
swept into eternity by D 192
swept into nothingness by D 186
sword must renounce the D 180
sweet face upturned to D 178
swoon were demanded by D 172
swore most solemnly to D 170
swept clear suddenly by D 166
sweep away hundreds of D 157
sword will probably do D 148
swept along unheeded in D 132
swept over hundreds of D 128
swept away therefore by D 126
swell more gigantic on D 114
swine were intended to D 111
swept over thousands of D 106
sworn most solemnly to D 104
sweet wine produced in D 104
sweep away barriers to D 100
sward just opposite to D 98

swept away whatever the D 82
sweep over hundreds of D 56
swept away thousands in D 54
sweep from shoulder to D 40

sworn right high indeed M 128
sweet sleep must depart M 110
sweet voice from behind M 98
sweet words like dropping M 92
sweet water cuts through M 92
sweet hours there passed M 92
sweet dreams were broken M 92
swain would have risked D 432
sweet voice came floating D 406
sword shall pass through D 228
sweet green bell pepper D 197
sweet woods mild lovers D 176
sweet shall their tongues D 162
swell within your breasts D 142
sword which cuts through D 131
swept every other thought D 130
swift stream from sweeping D 112
sweet smell when burned D 110
sword shall rise before D 104
sword alone must decide D 104
swift would have called D 98
swift would have envied D 94
swine feeding upon acorns D 85
sworn after their fashion D 80
swift would have agreed D 62
sweet salty sour bitter D 51

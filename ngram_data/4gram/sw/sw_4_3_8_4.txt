swung his attention back M 700
swung her attention back M 302
swear now therefore unto M 276
swap and currency swap M 118
swap and interest rate M 116
swung his attention from M 96
sweat that trickled down D 933
swat and adjacent hill D 282
swear with uplifted hand D 264
sway was extended over D 201
swung his clenched fist D 153
swam out waveringly from D 148
swinging his partisan over D 142
sweat that trickled from D 140
sway and struggle like D 135
swung her backpack over D 134
sweat that trickled into D 132
sweat had trickled down D 108
sweat that contains only D 106
swings and parallel bars D 102
swam with grateful tears D 96
sway they exercise over D 84
sweat that trickles down D 69
sway had extended over D 68
sway and undulate like D 50

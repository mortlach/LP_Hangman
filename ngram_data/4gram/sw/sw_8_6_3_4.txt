sweetest melody that ever D 638
sweetest smiles that ever D 386
sweetest flower that ever D 386
sweetest scents and airs D 294
swallows circling with their D 210
sweetest temper that ever D 150
swindler greater than other D 130
swallowing reflex has been D 126
swallows gathering for their D 116
sweltering fields and boxing D 112
switches itself off when D 106
swiveled around and said D 98
sweetheart turned her face D 84
sweetest spirit that ever D 43
swallows poison and dies D 42

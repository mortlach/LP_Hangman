as all servants are D 80
as air emissions and D 80
as they filtered out D 74
as she sprinted out D 61
as she strutted out D 60
as she tottered out D 56
as yet unmapped and D 55
as they lumbered out D 53
as low pressure and D 52
as not furnishing any D 51
as any minister that D 51
as not conferring any D 50
as ill comporting with D 50
as yet unbroken and D 48
as she stumbles out D 48
as lead managers for D 47
as she squinted out D 46
as two millennia ago D 45
as they scuttled out D 45
as new therapies for D 44
as she scuttled off D 43
as not suspending our D 43
as new minerals are D 43
as she affirmed that D 41
as new patients are D 41
as its standard that D 41
as yet unclothed with D 40
as she slithered off D 40
as our standard that D 40
as any physical one D 40

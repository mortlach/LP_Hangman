rest myself a little M 475
reading through a number M 284
ready framed a number M 268
rest breathes a spirit M 266
rest formed a circle M 248
ready without a moment M 212
reach beyond a narrow M 183
rest without a remedy M 179
rest without a thought M 145
reach toward a higher M 138
reading became a passion M 136
reading showed a little M 128
rest without a mental M 114
rest beside a little M 109
reading through a volume M 96
reach behind a screen M 93
rest through a little M 82
reading through a script M 80
rest through a height D 560
reach without a ladder D 255
reading through a series D 220
reading lately a letter D 126
reading through a bundle D 98
rest without a murmur D 43

atom can not be D 6257
atop her head in D 1698
atom and that the D 1381
atom that can be D 1250
atom and that of D 1185
atom and one of D 966
atom and can be D 698
atom that has an D 660
atom that has the D 654
atom and each of D 587
atom and for the D 573
atom was not the D 517
atom has one or D 517
atom can then be D 493
atom with one or D 463
atom and with the D 432
atom may not be D 425
atom and all the D 380
atom for one of D 366
atom can act as D 362
atom with that of D 347
atom and not the D 347
atom for each of D 337
atom may then be D 318
atom and may be D 315
atom that has no D 309
atria and then the D 308
atom with one of D 302
atop her head to D 296
atom can now be D 292
atop her head as D 291
atom was one of D 290
atom and one or D 272
atom can lead to D 270
atom with two or D 254
atom that may be D 246
atom has one of D 240
atom and thus the D 238
atom and all of D 224
atop his head as D 213
atom can thus be D 212
atop his head in D 210
atom that does so D 205
atom and that it D 204
atom with all the D 201
atom are due to D 194
atom and its ion D 194
atom has for the D 190
atom was that of D 181
atom and not to D 181
atom and this is D 180
atom with each of D 175
atom and then the D 174
atom now has an D 171
atria and that of D 170
atom has led to D 166
atom was due to D 161
atom was that it D 157
atom may lead to D 156
atom than does the D 155
atom and not of D 152
atom was not an D 150
atom than for the D 147
atom and how it D 144
atom than with the D 143
atom than that of D 142
atom has two or D 142
atom that goes to D 138
atom may thus be D 138
atom and not on D 133
atom and two of D 130
atom and then to D 128
atom than near the D 127
atom and has the D 126
atom may now be D 123
atom that was in D 121
atom are not the D 121
atom and one in D 121
atom than are the D 120
atop his head to D 118
atom has all the D 118
atom and put it D 116
atria can not be D 112
atom and that in D 110
atom was not in D 106
atop one end of D 104
atom and not in D 103
atom and not by D 100
atria and then to D 98
atom and one on D 98
atom but not to D 96
atom and was on D 96
atom and are the D 95
atom and one to D 94
atom but with the D 91
atom may act as D 86
atop his head he D 84
atom and how the D 84
atom but not in D 83
atom and that is D 80
atom are not in D 51
atop her head so D 45
atom then has an D 43
atom are not so D 43
atom and thus to D 43

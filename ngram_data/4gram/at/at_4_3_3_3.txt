atop her head and D 2970
atom has its own D 2177
atop his head and D 1236
atom that does not D 714
atop her head with D 704
atop his head was D 592
atom and can not D 476
atop her head was D 364
atom and does not D 335
atom that can not D 318
atom with its two D 300
atom that has two D 266
atom and are not D 236
atom has but one D 220
atom are not all D 216
atom and all its D 215
atom and its two D 212
atom that was you D 196
atom that are not D 190
atom and that this D 189
atom with all its D 185
atop his head with D 166
atom has not yet D 160
atom had not yet D 156
atom with its own D 146
atom with its one D 146
atom but does not D 143
atop his own head D 132
atom that has one D 131
atom has all its D 122
atom but can not D 118
atom and they are D 113
atom does not lie D 112
atom had its own D 105
atom now has one D 103
atom and its ions D 100
atom and are thus D 88
atop her and she D 86
atop her head she D 82
atom and not with D 80
atom that they are D 55
atom that has not D 50
atom then has two D 49
atom that did not D 47
atom that was not D 41

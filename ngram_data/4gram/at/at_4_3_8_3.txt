atom and molecule are D 452
atom can interact with D 325
atom and molecule and D 201
atom and molecule has D 198
atom per molecule and D 191
atom may interact with D 162
atom then combines with D 112
atom has replaced one D 110
atom and therefore has D 102
atom and electron are D 102
atom and therefore can D 98
atom that contains all D 86
atom that combines with D 43

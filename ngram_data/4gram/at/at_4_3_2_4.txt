atom and the other D 2001
atom with the same D 1223
atom can be used D 981
atom are the same D 925
atom and the atom D 768
atom than the other D 741
atom and an atom D 658
atom can be made D 644
atom and the three D 596
atom has as many D 498
atom and the four D 480
atop one of those D 442
atop one of these D 418
atom and the void D 399
atom that is part D 394
atom and the cell D 392
atom and the star D 380
atom and the next D 373
atom and the mass D 345
atom has the form D 334
atom may be said D 328
atom and the ether D 282
atom and the size D 280
atom can be seen D 276
atria and the left D 268
atom and the rest D 254
atom has at least D 253
atom and the bond D 242
atom and the same D 218
atom and at least D 217
atom may be used D 216
atom may be more D 216
atom can be said D 216
atom and so forth D 208
atom that we have D 203
atom with the other D 197
atom with an atom D 176
atom was the size D 168
atom and the host D 168
atom and the free D 168
atria and the great D 164
atom and the fact D 157
atom was at rest D 154
atom has no lone D 152
atom and is free D 152
atom may be left D 149
atom and we have D 148
atom and the leaving D 146
atom with the help D 144
atom with at least D 144
atom and the most D 142
atop one of their D 138
atom and the type D 137
atom that is also D 132
atom and ion beams D 132
atom may be made D 131
atom had the same D 127
atom with the most D 125
atom with the mass D 125
atom was the most D 123
atom for the case D 123
atom are the most D 122
atom and the more D 121
atria and the other D 118
atop all the other D 118
atom and the gene D 117
atom that is more D 116
atom and the spin D 110
atom was the same D 109
atom and the third D 108
atom has the most D 104
atom has to pass D 102

atom are in their D 90
atom may be able D 88
atom for an atom D 86
atom and the work D 86
atom for the same D 85
atom and no other D 84
atom can be very D 82

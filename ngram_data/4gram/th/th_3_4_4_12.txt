this time were considerable M 210
they have just accomplished M 210
that will most successfully M 210
that these same technologies M 210

this take into consideration M 208
they have more significance M 208

this time much dissatisfied M 207
they also have similarities M 206
them from other contemporary M 206
this time very particularly M 204
this good work accomplished M 204
they will take considerable M 204
they were most successfully M 204
they were most particularly M 204
they have also accomplished M 204
them from their superstitious M 204
that these were specifically M 204
that even when participants M 203
they have lost consciousness M 202
that much more consideration M 202
that have most significance M 202

this means more specifically M 200
they will have consequences M 200
they have most successfully M 200

that these very difficulties M 192
than five years successively M 192

thus have been considerably M 188
this book will sufficiently M 188
thus there were considerable M 186
they will have consideration M 186
they were more consistently M 186
they made very considerable M 186
they lose their concentration M 186
they have much significance M 186
then there were complications M 186
that such prior determination M 186
that many were disappointed M 186

this work have demonstrated M 184
this will more particularly M 184
this truth into consideration M 184
they were only sufficiently M 184
they come from dysfunctional M 184
that time were insufficient M 184
that these were philosophers M 184

this means these philosophers M 182
they will face difficulties M 182
they were even communicated M 182
they must have comprehended M 182
they have been inaccessible M 182
they have been approximated M 182
then look more specifically M 182

they fell into difficulties M 180
they feel their independence M 180
them into more constructive M 180
them have been communicated M 180
that will have irreversible M 180

they must have independence M 178
they made some modifications M 178
they also gave considerable M 178
them into their consideration M 178

this work been accomplished M 176
this kind have demonstrated M 176
this have been successfully M 176

this very much acknowledged M 154
this type have traditionally M 154
this time more aggressively M 154
this kind were subsequently M 154

this fact also demonstrates M 152

this love more intellectual M 142
this case were particularly M 142
they have been ideologically M 142

these for comparison with M 214
these are suggestions and M 214
these are structural and M 214
these are impressive and M 214
these are advantages not M 214
there are substances with M 214

these two evaluations are M 196
these two approaches had M 196
these new information and M 196
there are unexpected and M 196

there are remarkable and M 186
their own supporters that M 186

these two quantities that M 174
these are eliminated and M 174
there are occupations and M 174
there are injustices and M 174
there are incentives that M 174

those being persecuted and M 84
think you understood this M 84

these was remarkable for M 84
these two revolutions was M 84
these two paragraphs may M 84
these two conclusions was M 84
these two categories now M 84
these two approaches did M 84
these two appearances can M 84
these things distinctly and M 84
these new revelations are M 84

these men understood and M 84
these are substances and M 84
these are relatively non M 84

these was consistent with M 82
these two successive and M 82

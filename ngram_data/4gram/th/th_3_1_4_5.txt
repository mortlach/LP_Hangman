this a clear proof M 228
then i must fight M 228
then i must appeal M 228
then i have acted M 228
them a peace which M 228
that i think others M 228

them a great light M 213
them a fine field M 213
that a list which M 213
that a clear legal M 213
thus a more exact M 212
then i will light M 212
then i will cross M 212
then a high value M 212
that i think shows M 212
that i make today M 212

this i think quite M 204
this a good piece M 204
then i will enjoy M 204
then i said within M 204
then a single layer M 204
that i used while M 204

this cultural and spiritual M 244
this brilliant and thoughtful M 244
this agitation and uneasiness M 244
that children are typically M 244

this progress has continued M 238
this practice was tolerated M 238
this execution was appointed M 238
this criterion was developed M 238
this condition was previously M 238
this argument are discussed M 238
they asserted for themselves M 238
that nobleman was appointed M 238
that designed and developed M 237
this strategy can sometimes M 236
this conflict has continued M 236
this compound was identical M 236
this attitude was doubtless M 236
this approach and suggested M 236
they believed and practiced M 236
then received his dismissal M 236
that followed his dismissal M 236
that subjects are generated M 235
that concerns you interests M 235
this tradition was inherited M 234
this strategy was extremely M 234
this proposal was confirmed M 234
this nobleman was descended M 234
this movement was certainly M 234
this exercise was suggested M 234
this condition are sometimes M 234
this category are associated M 234
they renounce his protection M 234
they purchase for themselves M 234
they consider this necessary M 234
that whenever they attempted M 233

this interest was motivated M 232
this attitude was sometimes M 232
this argument was difficult M 232
that students see themselves M 232
that precedes and surrounds M 232
thus obtained for different M 230
this brilliant and versatile M 230
this approach are explained M 230
this analysis and conclusion M 230
they perceive for themselves M 230
that wherever his followers M 230
that provides for continued M 230
that followed his appearance M 230
thus obtained was converted M 228
this suggests that excessive M 228
this movement was instantly M 228
this interest was continued M 228
this disorder are described M 228
this direction was necessary M 228
this direction was attempted M 228
this approach was basically M 228
then suddenly she exclaimed M 228
that calmness and composure M 228
that absolute and perpetual M 228
that preceded her departure M 227
that materials are delivered M 227
thus supporting our hypothesis M 226
this situation and suggested M 226
this proposal was favorably M 226
this argument was discussed M 226
this analysis with reference M 226
that parental and community M 226
this approach and developed M 225
that valuable and interesting M 225
that supports and surrounds M 225
this virtuous and blameless M 224
this supports our conclusion M 224
this suggests that perception M 224
this proposal has generated M 224
this movement was extremely M 224
this juncture may determine M 224
this finishes our discussion M 224
this evidence was submitted M 224
this approach are sometimes M 224
they returned and announced M 224
that whenever two different M 224
that surround and undermine M 224
that students can distinguish M 224
that connects two computers M 224
that citizens can influence M 224
that threatened his existence M 223
that property was purchased M 223
thus captured and expressed M 222
this direction was performed M 222
this argument was repeatedly M 222
this approach has increasingly M 222
this analysis are important M 222
they returned that afternoon M 222
that required for inhibition M 222
that produced and supported M 222
that document was published M 222
that children see themselves M 222
that admitted being shortened M 222
that precedes and conditions M 221
that children who performed M 221
this tendency was certainly M 220
this situation with reference M 220
this involves two important M 220

this situation any different M 218
they covenant with arbitrary M 218
they accepted his suggestion M 218

that judgment was delivered M 218
that interest was generally M 218

this suggests that transport M 216
this response was especially M 216
this requires two different M 216
this judgment was supported M 216
this disorder may represent M 216
this confusion and ambiguity M 216
this argument has generally M 216

they suffered not themselves M 216
they received and protected M 216
that practice was abandoned M 216
that included this statement M 216

they obtained this privilege M 204
they designed and developed M 204
then compared and evaluated M 204

this response you evidently M 156
this operation are excellent M 156
this movement was connected M 156
this industry are generally M 156
this category are especially M 156
this attitude has sometimes M 156
they observed and described M 156
they imagined they possessed M 156
they competed for resources M 156
they abounded with traditions M 156
that treatment for substance M 156
that required for protection M 156
that preceded his appearance M 156
that marriages are generally M 156
that children are perfectly M 156
that students can visualize M 155
that somebody has committed M 155
that examines and evaluates M 155
thus provided for themselves M 154
this treatment was abandoned M 154
this tendency was naturally M 154
this struggle for possession M 154
this situation was primarily M 154
this reflects our assumption M 154
this argument and suggested M 154
this activity was suggested M 154
this activity was completed M 154
they survived for centuries M 154
then unfolded his hypothesis M 154
then reported and discussed M 154
then compared with previously M 154
that troubled him throughout M 154
that students ask themselves M 154
that students are naturally M 154
that property and equipment M 154
that patterns and processes M 154
that immature and imperfect M 154
that describe each character M 154
that children with imaginary M 154
they struggle and sacrifice M 153
that children are challenged M 153
this suggests that frequency M 152
this profound and difficult M 152
this intention was confirmed M 152
this horrible man confessed M 152
this emphasis was especially M 152
this direction was published M 152
this direction are suggested M 152
this coldness and blindness M 152
this brilliant and important M 152
this argument was challenged M 152
this approach was questioned M 152
this approach and concluded M 152
they achieved for themselves M 152
then examined and evaluated M 152
then decreases and disappears M 152
them replaced with artificial M 152
that whenever any important M 152
that tradition and precedent M 152
that supports its existence M 152
that interest and gratitude M 152
that includes all countries M 152
that followed that statement M 152

that isolation and alienation M 151
that decisions are generally M 151
this strategy are presented M 150
this proposal was applauded M 150
this profound and universal M 150
this practice can sometimes M 150
this movement had succeeded M 150
this enormous and important M 150
this eagerness for knowledge M 150
this approach are encouraging M 150
they retained for centuries M 150
they listened not unwillingly M 150
that whatever was available M 150
that subjects who responded M 150
that students use different M 150
that students are compelled M 150
that produces two different M 150
that performs all arithmetic M 150
that hardness and whiteness M 150
that families are increasingly M 150
that cultures and traditions M 150
that citizens are generally M 150
that benefits all concerned M 150
that preceded its appearance M 149
thus affected are generally M 148
this suggests how important M 148
this proposal was certainly M 148
this perilous and important M 148
this operation was accordingly M 148
this attitude was explained M 148
they embarked and proceeded M 148
they combined and conspired M 148
they assessed and collected M 148
that terrible and wonderful M 148
that requires two arguments M 148
that provides for protection M 148
that children are deficient M 148
that attempts are sometimes M 148
that advances our knowledge M 148
than ordinary and necessary M 148
than abstract and universal M 148
that property was necessary M 147
that impulses are conducted M 147
thus strangely put themselves M 146
this suggests that generally M 146
this situation and establish M 146
this powerful new technique M 146
this industry has continued M 146
this disorder was previously M 146
this compound was confirmed M 146
this ceremony being completed M 146
this activity are described M 146
them wherever they travelled M 146
that students are especially M 146
that monarchy was abolished M 146
that identity and community M 146
that distance and separation M 146
that critical and important M 146
that confusion and obscurity M 146
this despised and neglected M 145
that overcame all opposition M 145
thus obtained are collected M 144
thus distinct and unrelated M 144
thus adjusted all necessary M 144
this suggests that controlling M 144
this situation was suggested M 144
this situation than elsewhere M 144
this situation and sometimes M 144
this proposal and appointed M 144
this prophecy being fulfilled M 144
this property and purchased M 144
this practice has important M 144
this monitoring and evaluation M 144
this interest has generated M 144
this condition are difficult M 144
this audience may enlighten M 144
this assertion with reference M 144
this approach are difficult M 144
this activity was connected M 144
they prepared and submitted M 144
them beautiful and interesting M 144
that supports this viewpoint M 144
that supports our hypothesis M 144
that students can integrate M 144
that selection and adaptation M 144
that precedes all reflection M 144
that judgment and inference M 144
that impulses are generated M 144
that everyone was basically M 144
that children who perceived M 144
that patience and tolerance M 143
that otherwise are available M 143
thus obtained are subjected M 142
thus initiated was continued M 142
this suggests that evaluation M 142
this movement was perceived M 142
this direction was conducted M 142
this condition was temporary M 142
this condition was presently M 142
this category was estimated M 142
this business for themselves M 142
they generate new knowledge M 142
they designed for themselves M 142
then forwards and downwards M 142
that whatever has prospered M 142
that sustains and justifies M 142
that requires two witnesses M 142
that operation being performed M 142
that normally are connected M 142
that everyone who considers M 142
that authority was necessary M 142
this suggests that protection M 141
that promises and contracts M 141
thus degraded and miserable M 140
this treatment are generally M 140
this tradition was especially M 140
this suggests that stability M 140
this situation has prevented M 140
this situation and attempted M 140
this exercise are displayed M 140
this evidence they concluded M 140
this document was witnessed M 140
this disorder are typically M 140
this deserved that character M 140
they listened with composure M 140
they accepted his conditions M 140
then attacked and conquered M 140
them suitable for practical M 140
that utilizes all available M 140
that students who preferred M 140
that struggle for dominance M 140
that practice was continued M 140
that patience and persuasion M 140

that authority and obedience M 140
that sustains and strengthens M 139
that constant and permanent M 139
that capacity for happiness M 139
this treatment are presented M 138
this suggests that mortality M 138
this strategy was continued M 138
this explains why throughout M 138
this criterion was suggested M 138
this condition was sometimes M 138
this argument was published M 138
they remained for seventeen M 138
they despised and neglected M 138
they consider them important M 138
they believed him supported M 138
they acquired and displayed M 138
then conclude with certainty M 138
them security and stability M 138
that whenever our connection M 138
that threatened its stability M 138
that sustains our existence M 138
that students and lecturers M 138
that strangers are generally M 138
that machines are incapable M 138

that followed she continued M 138

that assembly was dissolved M 138
that practice and procedure M 137
that maturity and perfection M 137
that involved but uncertain M 137
that darkness and ignorance M 137
this situation was challenged M 136
this security and stability M 136
this provides two important M 136
this majestic and mysterious M 136
this constant and necessary M 136
this condition are identical M 136
they believed that conditions M 136
that suspicion may reasonably M 136
that subjects are typically M 136
that prevents his undertaking M 136
that motivate and constrain M 136
that followed her discovery M 136

that controls eye movements M 135
that complete and corrected M 135
that afforded them protection M 135
thus produced being inherited M 134
thus confirming our hypothesis M 134
this suggests that virtually M 134
this operation was developed M 134
this integral was evaluated M 134
this inherent and continual M 134
this direction are important M 134
this approach was conceived M 134
they designed and conducted M 134
they afforded him amusement M 134
then extended his influence M 134
then compared with estimates M 134

this contrast was especially M 132
this condition was permanent M 132
this condition for centuries M 132
this beautiful but difficult M 132
this argument was important M 132
this approach and attempted M 132
this appendix has attempted M 132
this activity has developed M 132
they suddenly see themselves M 132
they navigate this interesting M 132
then extended his researches M 132
then computed and displayed M 132
that sickness had prevented M 132

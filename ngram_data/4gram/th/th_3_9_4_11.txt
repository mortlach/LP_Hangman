this principle must necessarily M 336
this technique very effectively M 332
then continued their conversation M 320

this technique most effectively M 188

this discussion also illustrates M 180
this connection some observations M 178
this statement also illustrates M 176

this hypothesis also contradicts M 120
this conclusion will undoubtedly M 120
this collection will demonstrate M 120

this conclusion from observations M 110

this statement well illustrates M 100
this desirable site transferred M 100
this objective more effectively M 98
this knowledge will undoubtedly M 98
them throughout their development M 98
that satisfies these restrictions M 98
they explained their observations M 96
that resources were distributed M 95
this important city surrendered M 94
this conclusion must necessarily M 94

they certainly have contributed M 92

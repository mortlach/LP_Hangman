gallantly fought his way D 322
gallantly fighting for his D 250
garrulous fabric that was D 192
gallantly fought and won D 152
gallantly cheering his men D 148
gallantly fought its way D 134
gallantly offering his arm D 122
gallantly offering her his D 106
galleries filled with old D 96
gallantly threaded her way D 90
gallantly pulled off his D 90
gasometer filled with air D 80

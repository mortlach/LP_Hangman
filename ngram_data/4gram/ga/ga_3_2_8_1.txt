gap by developing a M 400
gap by presenting a M 370
gap is actually a M 156
gap is therefore a M 106
gas to maintain a D 460
gas is therefore a D 380
gas to disperse a D 326
gas at constant t D 200
gas is actually a D 134
gas is probably a D 108
gas it produces a D 104
gas to generate a D 90
gap of thickness d D 88
gas is rendered a D 80

wanted to write lyrics D 88
wanted to write comedy D 88
wanted to marry madame D 88
walked or rather glided D 88
waters of polar origin D 86
washed the morning dishes D 86
wanted to change policy D 86
wanted the scene played D 86
wander the house unshod D 86
waiter in white gloves D 86
waters the tossing lights D 84
waters of civil strife D 84
watching the winking lights D 84
watching the waves splash D 84
watching the sweep second D 84
watching the smoke vanish D 84
watching the falling flakes D 84
wanted to paint scenes D 84
wanted to drive faster D 84
wanted to drink before D 84
wanted to dance through D 84
wagons the night before D 84
waters of which rolled D 82
watching the train station D 82
watching the dancing lights D 82
washed up after supper D 82
wanted to trade freely D 82
wanted the extra income D 82
watching the water swirling D 80
watching the scene across D 80
wanted to shake itself D 80
wanted to raise troops D 80
wanted to order drinks D 80
wanted to dress nicely D 80
waiter to serve dinner D 80
wanted to weigh anchor D 64
wanted to scout around D 57
wanted to prowl around D 50
wanted to court martial D 48
watching the smoke spiral D 47
wanted to start drinking D 43
watching the smoke ascend D 42
wanted to avoid shooting D 42

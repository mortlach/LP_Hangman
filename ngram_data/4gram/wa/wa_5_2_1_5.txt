walks on a knife D 44
waves on a still D 43
water as a rinsing D 43
watch in a movie D 43
waves of a burning D 42
waves in a fixed D 42
water to a putty D 42
water in a steaming D 42
watch or a jewel D 42
water or a flush D 41
water in a hydro D 41
warning as a bluff D 41
wants of a widow D 41
waxed to a glass D 40
waves of a longer D 40
water by a valve D 40
watch as a dozen D 40
warning of a looming D 40

watchful over himself when M 1026
wandered during several years M 242
watchful over oneself when M 168
wavelength range extending from D 349
wallowed like trodden sand D 268
wavelength range results from D 260
wavelength range extends from D 189
wandered like beggars from D 166
wayfarer were vanishing fast D 140
waterway port coastal ocean D 136
watchers heard muffled sobs D 132

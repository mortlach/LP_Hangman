watched what looked like M 308
watched from behind their M 296
watched these events from M 220
watched from behind some M 152
watched what seemed like M 130
wandering free through these M 110
watched their motions from M 88
watched their effect upon M 84
warfare have always been D 278
warriors were mounting their D 210
warfare have turned their D 210
warriors were always among D 188
warriors have always been D 188
warriors were struck down D 161
watched till thrones were D 148
warriors were driven back D 136
warriors were marching down D 134
warriors were called upon D 126
warfare will suffer once D 126
wandering down memory lane D 123
warrant your cousin will D 108
wandering gaze sweeping over D 106
watered their horses there D 104
warriors were absent from D 104
warfare have become more D 104
warriors were already taking D 98
warfare have already been D 96
warheads have already been D 94
wandering over breezy down D 92
warriors were driven into D 88
wartime many losses must D 84
warriors have already been D 80

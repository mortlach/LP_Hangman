wails of infinite pain D 82
waged in isolation from D 82
walls of palmetto logs D 81
waves of enthusiasm among D 80
waves of aircraft from D 80
waves at ordinary high D 80
wants to preserve from D 80
wanting to register their D 80
waiting the promised bite D 80
waves of infinite wave D 70
wants to disengage from D 45
wages of education sink D 41
washing the delicate tint D 40

face would become so D 124
face varying levels of D 124
faith would become the D 122
farm tools should be D 120
faith would indeed be D 120
fair hover through the D 120
fact which belies the D 120
fact would surely be D 118
face would return to D 116
farm which served as D 114
farm labor through the D 114
face angled toward the D 114
fate would surely be D 112
farm later became the D 112
fame rests firmly on D 112
fact every feature of D 112
farm lands around the D 110
farm lands around it D 110
farm could afford to D 110
faith would thereby be D 110
fail after spending so D 110
face which reveals the D 110
face changing colour as D 110
fate which dogged the D 108
fast flowing streams in D 108
fair stone bridge of D 108
fact would afford no D 108
fact would afford me D 108
farm lands beyond the D 106
farm board sought to D 106
faith which exalts the D 106
face would betray me D 106
face grave enough to D 106
face broad enough to D 106
farm units should be D 104
fans sitting behind the D 104
fans could relate to D 104
fans could listen to D 104
face would follow me D 104
face would assume the D 104
fans could follow the D 102
fair stock appears to D 102
fading light robbed the D 102
farm hands looked at D 100
fans would prefer to D 100
fact which struck us D 100
face shone partly in D 100
face sheet should be D 100
fall below levels of D 99
farm women should be D 97
fate would indeed be D 96
fact would become the D 96
face which stared at D 96
fast setting behind the D 94
farm could hardly be D 94
fangs which yawned at D 94
face still frozen in D 94
fast growing sector in D 93
fate nearly befell the D 92
farm sizes should be D 92
fame rather belongs to D 92
fact alone places the D 92
facing right instead of D 92
face would become as D 92
fact would likely be D 90
facing arrow button to D 90
face which belied the D 90
farm would become the D 88
farm would always be D 88
farm bureau leaders in D 88
fare within plunged in D 88
faith would hardly be D 88
fain avail myself of D 88
fact which brooks no D 88
fact pending before the D 88
fame could hardly be D 86
fact would depend on D 86
fact which upsets the D 86
facing either toward or D 86
farm plans should be D 84
fall below freezing on D 84
fair trade should be D 84
face would pucker up D 84
face would betray my D 84
farm would remain in D 82
fame still further at D 82
fact which roused the D 82
facing either plenty or D 82
face which struck the D 82
face which glared at D 82
face grave almost to D 82
fate would permit the D 80
farm still belongs to D 80
farm lanes toward the D 80
farm labor strike in D 80
fair speed through the D 80
fact which places it D 80
face whose radius is D 80
farm labor supply of D 72
face brick should be D 60
fast flowing rivers of D 56
fast growing section of D 51
fake smile pasted on D 45
fain would listen to D 44

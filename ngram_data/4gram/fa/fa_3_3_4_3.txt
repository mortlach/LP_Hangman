far east call for M 128
far and what has M 128
far and very near M 127
far too young then M 126
far too ugly for M 126
far too high but M 126
far this view can M 126
far things have not M 126
far and wide long M 126

far are ones that M 122
far too much one M 121
far you will see M 120
far too well read M 120
far too boring for M 120
far this rule has M 120
far this ideal has M 120

far and high that M 120
far for some and M 119
far with eager and M 118
far too weary for M 118
far too much now M 118
far too much ease M 118
far this step was M 118
far this ideal can M 118
far are much too M 118
far are more than M 118
far this fact has M 116
far out over that M 116

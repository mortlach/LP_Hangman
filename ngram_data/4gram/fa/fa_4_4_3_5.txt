fall from her sight D 89
farm took her fancy D 88
fame time they would D 88
fall into that loafing D 88
fall into that genre D 88
fall into its snare D 88
fair game for jokes D 88
fair dealing that would D 88
fain have set aside D 88
fast heart her breast D 87
farm work and fishing D 87
fair wage and working D 87
face north and march D 87
face like you would D 87
face clean and shining D 87
fast cars and loose D 86
farm size has risen D 86
fare from ten cents D 86
fans were not aware D 86
fair face was shining D 86
fact like this would D 86
face grow hot under D 86
face from her apron D 86
farm more than anything D 85
farm land and labor D 85
face down and rolling D 85
farm early that morning D 84
farm early one morning D 84
fall over his stool D 84
fall from her dizzy D 84
fair hair was swept D 84
fain tell you fully D 84
fall from one scene D 83
fall down and smash D 83
fate must and would D 82
fast losing its charm D 82
fast food and vending D 82
fans have long since D 82
fame upon one lyric D 82
fall upon and inlay D 82
fair fame and honor D 82
fain have you aware D 82
farm life not found D 80
fall upon our flank D 80
fair skin and ruddy D 80
face upon his chest D 80
face pale and grave D 68
fast moving and changing D 67
fall from his steed D 66
farm soil and water D 58
fall upon her cheek D 58
farm work and teaching D 53
farm size and scale D 52
fall from her waist D 52
fall upon our souls D 51
facing page and below D 51
farm like his father D 50
fall into icy water D 49
fall from its lofty D 49
fall down and scream D 49
face lost its flush D 49
face pale and beaded D 47
fall into that broad D 46
fall into one broad D 46
fall upon his tongue D 45
fall from her breast D 45
farm land and farming D 44
face when they would D 44
face pink and shiny D 44
face pale and livid D 44
fall from his chest D 43
fall upon his cheek D 42
fall into this chasm D 42
fall from his knees D 42
fall from her apron D 42
face pale and bathed D 42
fast cars and motor D 41
farm work and house D 41
fall upon them ranting D 41
face full and ruddy D 41
fall from that level D 40
face pale with grief D 40

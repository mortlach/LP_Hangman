smiles from reason flow M 878
smiles must hurry away M 200
smiles back again upon M 156
smiled from heaven upon M 80
smoked pipe after pipe D 566
smacking their whips like D 192
smocks came running down D 170
smells most awful vile D 158
smelling like white bread D 146
smelling body enter into D 133
smells like burning hair D 130
smokes like burning turf D 128
smells like stale beer D 108
smokes from morning till D 106
smoked their pipes over D 100
smoked their pipes during D 90
smelling salt water down D 88
smells like rotting fish D 82
smoked pack after pack D 80

smiled when their eyes M 422
smiled once more upon M 280
smiled even more when M 244
smiled upon their union M 186
smiles have been shed M 144
smiled from your clear M 100
smiles were gone from M 86
smiles must have been M 80
smacking their lips over D 1050
smells were coming from D 602
smiles upon their lips D 465
smells very much like D 447
smarting from having been D 342
smiled down into hers D 253
smoked baby back ribs D 250
smoked hams hanging from D 190
smother their anger when D 162
smelling very much like D 158
smacking your lips over D 154
smells like sour milk D 152
smells like nothing else D 134
smelting must have been D 129
smacking their lips like D 122
smarting from their loss D 120
smells like some kind D 118
smoothing hand down over D 108
smarting from having lost D 106
smokes rising among these D 102
smelling like sour milk D 102
smoothing down their hair D 100
smacks have done more D 100
smarting fall away from D 98
smells like baking bread D 90

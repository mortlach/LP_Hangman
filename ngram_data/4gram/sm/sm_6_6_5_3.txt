smiled without opening her M 458
smiled without showing his M 366
smiled without opening his M 358
smiled without showing her M 224
smiled without humor and M 200
smiled without parting his M 182
smiled without knowing why M 180
smiled without showing any M 150
smiles played about her M 122
smiled without speaking and M 96
smoked another joint and D 134
smites common sense and D 124
smashing through doors and D 108
smiled almost shyly and D 106
smiled grimly under his D 92

smiles once more began M 234
smiled upon these armed M 140
smiles upon your cause M 100
smiled down from above M 69
smarting from their defeat D 1260
smiles upon their faces D 1144
smeared over their faces D 444
smiles from their faces D 365
smiley during these times D 260
smoked their clay pipes D 198
smiles left their faces D 182
smoked over wood fires D 158
smarting over their defeat D 134
smelting have been found D 124
smacking kiss just under D 104
smiles gleam over white D 94
smells like pine trees D 86
smoked salt pork bacon D 80

ice crystals and the D 1664
ice crystals can be D 961
ice formation and the D 778
ice crystals may be D 732
ice thickness and the D 655
ice retreated and the D 508
ice formation can be D 380
ice movement and the D 328
ice thickness can be D 285
ice whatever was to D 284
ice crystals with the D 236
icy contempt for the D 224
ice crystals due to D 215
ice crystals and to D 208
ice formation may be D 204
ice crystals near the D 204
ice crystals and is D 200
ice movement can be D 199
ice crystals are in D 177
ice thickness for the D 174
ice indicate that the D 160
ice crystals are so D 154
ice formation due to D 148
ice compared with the D 138
ice crystals are the D 126
ice crystals off the D 124
ice crystals are of D 121
ice crystals and in D 118
ice retreated for the D 106
ice crystals that do D 106
ice dynamics and the D 105
ice suggests that the D 104
ice required for the D 102
ice pressure and the D 101
ice reminded them of D 100
ice extended all the D 100
ice crystals out of D 94
ice surfaces and the D 93
ice treatment can be D 92
ice velocity and the D 88
ice movement may be D 86
ice formation and to D 84
ice formation and of D 84
ice loosened and the D 82
ice crystals act as D 55
ice crystals and so D 46

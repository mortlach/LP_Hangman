sky grows darker yet M 920
sky grows darker and M 208
sky seems filled with M 202
sky after sunset and M 162
sky growing darker and M 132
sky opens beyond them M 120
sky showing through its M 116
sky looks bright but M 100
sky above filled with M 100
sky while rounding off M 92
sky still bright with M 86
sky still glowed with D 256
sky would darken and D 194
sky mingled darkly with D 140
sky grows redder and D 124
sky shining through its D 118
sky shining through them D 80

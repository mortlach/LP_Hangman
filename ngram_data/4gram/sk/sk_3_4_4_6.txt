sky free from clouds M 426
sky shed their virtue M 244
sky grew even darker M 171
sky grew less gloomy M 152
sky into three pieces M 144
sky upon some lonely M 142
sky turn upon itself M 114
sky must have fallen M 96
sky once more before M 90
sky grew ever darker M 88
sky look more fearful M 86
sky must have seemed M 82
sky over pearl harbor D 260
sky beating their golden D 150
sky over those houses D 132
sky sank down before D 122
sky having been cloudy D 82

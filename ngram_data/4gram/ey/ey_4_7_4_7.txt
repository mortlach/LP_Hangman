eyes besides mine watched M 200
eyes towards their ancient M 124
eyes resumed their natural M 124
eyes flashed like lightning D 782
eyes sparkling like diamonds D 382
eyes widened like saucers D 366
eyes tightly shut against D 352
eyes sparkle like diamonds D 308
eyes widened into saucers D 170
eyed females were crossed D 134
eyes screwed shut against D 120
eyes flashed like diamonds D 120
eyes kindled into rapture D 116
eyes flashed like torches D 92

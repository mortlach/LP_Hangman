eyes followed the conversation M 86
eyes sparkled in anticipation D 440
eyes twinkled in anticipation D 150
eyes narrowed in disapproval D 148
eyes narrowed in anticipation D 108
eyes regarded me thoughtfully D 102
eyes glittering in anticipation D 94
eyes reflecting the candlelight D 92
eyes disgusts my understanding D 88

eye caught something moving M 276
eye caught something else M 172
eye should always look M 126
eye looked pretty fine M 116
eye needed neither road M 84
eye plunged direct upon D 164
eye already beheld rich D 112
eye seemed already beaming D 108
eye through closed lids D 96
eye struck terror into D 92

eyes never missed a M 330
eyes looking through a M 228
eyes still closed i M 216
eyes meeting across a M 202
eyes which showed a M 168
eyes which argued a M 136
eyes still looked a M 102
eyes could detect a M 92
eyes peering through a D 440
eyes shone through a D 368
eyes glare through a D 256
eyes shining through a D 242
eyes peeping through a D 162
eyes staring through a D 136
eyes sweep across a D 90
eyes would assume a D 86
eyes never beheld a D 80
eyes gleaming through a D 80

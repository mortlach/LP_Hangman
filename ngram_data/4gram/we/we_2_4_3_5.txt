we have long known M 20394
we need not repeat M 20092
we must all appear M 20088
we were off again M 19762

we were all happy M 12092
we find that every M 12088
we will not worry M 11824
we have now shown M 11814
we find that after M 11770
we knew all about M 11532
we must not waste M 11419
we have not lived M 11240
we were now about M 11197
we need not pause M 11158
we give you thanks M 10931
we were all looking M 10812
we have had quite M 10609
we must not blame M 10604
we have thus shown M 10360
we were not about M 10259
we have now taken M 10212
we were not willing M 9990
we find that about M 9976
we have read about M 9963
we have and hence M 9946
we were all getting M 9878
we hope and trust M 9802
we find that people M 9678
we will not waste M 9578
we open our hearts M 9514
we must set aside M 9452
we will not serve M 9334
we told him about M 9270
we were all still M 9232
we have all sorts M 9202
we must not infer M 9164
we were all waiting M 9130
we will not change M 9006

we need not waste M 8894
we will not spend M 8728
we wash our hands M 8722
we must put aside M 8722
we were not thinking M 8710
we were all taken M 8622
we have two types M 8598
we know that women M 8562
we leave this place M 8500
we know that while M 8431
we were all working M 8331
we were all quite M 8328
we were not happy M 8298
we note that since M 8238
we were all alone M 8210
we have not moved M 8114
we were all given M 8084
we left this place M 8054
we have thus found M 7986
we were not working M 7954
we were all feeling M 7830
we were now within M 7816
we will not touch M 7807
we find that which M 7742
we were all thinking M 7683

we held our first M 7122
we were each given M 7086
we need not spend M 7070
we have not spent M 6946
we will now study M 6923
we find that women M 6894
we were being taken M 6888
we find that under M 6848
we were both working M 6781
we have had ample M 6720
we need not refer M 6674
we have our share M 6625
we will now focus M 6594
we were too close M 6550
we were all rather M 6486
we were not asked M 6476
we must all stand M 6376
we will now apply M 6364
we have not learnt M 6341
we find that though M 6284
we must not limit M 6258
we note that while M 6248
we were both thinking M 6184
we need not argue M 6148
we were then taken M 6108
we find him still M 6084
we went out again M 6048
we must not close M 6042
we lose our sense M 6020
we must lay aside M 6004

we must not trust M 5723
we speak and write M 5649
we have not ceased M 5606
we have with others M 5602
we find that nearly M 5588
we must not delay M 5542
we will not really M 5530
we must now begin M 5486
we must use every M 5420
we know that where M 5404
we knew and loved M 5392
we must not dwell M 5358
we must ask about M 5332
we have our hands M 5204
we find that since M 5186
we find out where M 5180
we left him alone M 5148
we give and grant M 5144
we were being asked M 5137
we were both still M 5134
we were not strong M 5110
we have two cases M 5052
we must not count M 4990
we were two hours M 4986
we will not yield M 4982
we must not press M 4958
we have thus given M 4956
we were all sorry M 4950
we have and since M 4924
we were not under M 4921
we hope that after M 4902
we need not search M 4894

we have not often M 4675
we know how often M 4672
we will not agree M 4670
we need not agree M 4656
we were out walking M 4652
we will try again M 4621
we reach that point M 4615
we must and shall M 4598
we have now under M 4579
we dare not trust M 4568
we tell you about M 4562
we will not start M 4558

we meet with cases M 4070
we were now getting M 4060
we need not trace M 4034
we were both happy M 4022
we must see about M 4022
we were now close M 4020
we must not begin M 4014
we have yet found M 4003
we hold that under M 3998
we were not taken M 3978
we must not touch M 3972
we held our breaths M 3954
we must set about M 3930
we have not grown M 3908

we must not apply M 3672
we want our people M 3670
we have this morning M 3670
we used this method M 3668
we call this method M 3664

we were two miles M 1944
we find that hence M 1940
we must not appear M 1938
we were ten miles M 1936
we lost our power M 1930
we were then asked M 1924
we must not claim M 1922
we learn that about M 1922
we were now running M 1914

we made our share M 308
we lose our reason M 308
we live and write M 308
we leave day after M 308
we know this today M 308
we know this could M 308
we hope our study M 308
we have our child M 308
we have one night M 308
we have are quite M 308
we find two quite M 308
we find two people M 308

we work and study M 307
we were then getting M 306
we were not falling M 306
we went and lived M 306

we know that costs M 304
we have two known M 304
we have not hearts M 304
we have him still M 304
we find our reason M 304
we find him getting M 304
we felt that maybe M 304
we ever see anything M 304
we came out above M 304
we must let loose M 303

we need not store M 300
we need both sides M 300
we must pay equal M 300
we lost our hearts M 300
we know that party M 300
we know and still M 300

we were all sadly M 298
we take our minds M 298
we need but trace M 298
we must lay claim M 298
we must ask whose M 298
we look for first M 298
we knew that since M 298
we here are speaking M 298
we have two clues M 298
we have thus built M 298
we have not equal M 298
we have had rough M 298

we note that nearly M 296
we need his grace M 296
we must not quote M 296
we must ask later M 296
we make our hearts M 296
we left off burning M 296

we seek and which M 294
we name our stealing M 294
we live and whose M 294
we learn that father M 294
we know not quite M 294
we knew who could M 294
we find that action M 294
we need and value M 293
we must all abide M 293
we hope our elder M 293
we have this theorem M 293
we were too large M 292
we were not alert M 292
we were all spread M 292
we think that money M 292
we need not stray M 292
we must not cover M 292

we know has taken M 290
we have our times M 290
we find his words M 290
we find and where M 290
we call our moral M 290
we were then seated M 289
we will now dwell M 288
we were off about M 288
we were all drawing M 288
we want our hearts M 288
we treat our women M 288
we think that makes M 288
we talk all night M 288

we need not laugh M 288
we must now count M 288
we must deal later M 288
we make one false M 288
we left them still M 288
we have won after M 288
we have one whole M 288
we have one place M 288
we have for water M 288
we feel and which M 288
we also see signs M 288
we have had earthly M 287
we said that after M 286
we must all yield M 286
we meet with small M 286
we meet with later M 286
we meet all sorts M 286
we make them aware M 286
we know you really M 286
we know them under M 286
we know that delay M 286
we have thus fixed M 286
we have one right M 286
we have had warning M 286
we give them water M 286
we gave god thanks M 286
we form our words M 286
we find this rather M 286
we find them nearly M 286
we find that parts M 286
we will but purge M 284
we were not raising M 284
we need ten times M 284
we must see people M 284
we have that people M 284
we have now rather M 284
we have for women M 284
we were near water M 283
we went out front M 283
we time and again M 283
we look and sound M 283
we were thus waiting M 282
we were not angels M 282
we told this story M 282
we seek and enjoy M 282
we open its pages M 282
we made our evening M 282
we love our enemy M 282
we lose our minds M 282

we know how prone M 282
we know and could M 282
we knew our father M 282
we keep going round M 282
we hope they never M 282
we hope our people M 282
we find its author M 282
we break this cycle M 282
we were all alert M 281
we must then infer M 281
we will not belong M 280
we were not passing M 280
we were but forty M 280
we want our loved M 280
we want all facts M 280
we told her where M 280
we take that route M 280
we rest our claim M 280
we need him right M 280
we must not prove M 280
we made this place M 280
we lose our right M 280
we have got ample M 280
we find them spread M 280
we felt that under M 280
we feel that words M 280

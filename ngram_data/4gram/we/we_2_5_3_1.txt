we paint with a D 128
we dress for a D 128
we tarry for a D 126
we gazed was a D 126
we stare for a D 124
we mingled with a D 124
we nearly hit a D 122
we spake not a D 120
we shook and i D 120
we cleave not a D 120
we dined was a D 118
we gazed with a D 116
we would bear a D 114
we shine with a D 114
we froze for a D 112
we drove and i D 112
we thrill with a D 110
we voted him a D 108
we scoop out a D 108
we trade with a D 104
we meanly buy a D 102
we would mean a D 100
we spake with a D 100
we rowed out a D 100
we exult that a D 98
we endow with a D 98
we could spy a D 98
we voted them a D 96
we split off a D 96
we would spy a D 92
we would and i D 92
we shall dig a D 92
we gotta put a D 92
we dined out a D 92
we staid for a D 91
we spoke had a D 90
we would rear a D 88
we drove was a D 88
we drink you a D 88
we trade off a D 86
we often fee a D 86
we dozed for a D 86
we waded for a D 82
we could tap a D 82
we waved them a D 80
we relax with a D 80
we brand him a D 80

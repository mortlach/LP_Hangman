we remember from that M 114
we practice like this M 114
we perceive what has M 114
we graduate from this M 114
we entirely love and M 114
we discover some day M 114

we consider from now M 114
we conceive these two M 114

we wondered more and M 104
we wandered among them M 104
we therefore hold this M 104
we suffered these things M 104
we suddenly knew that M 104
we overcome those who M 104
we observed what was M 104

we continue like that M 42
we probably felt that M 41
we received news that D 4000
we alighted from our D 2418

we imported more than D 686
we bestowed upon him D 676
we received wine and D 668
we crouched down and D 658
we ardently hope that D 621
we joyfully took our D 608
we resolved upon our D 552
we honestly feel that D 550
we procured from them D 526
we obviously will not D 526
we therefore took our D 518

we bantered back and D 464
we commonly find them D 444
we commonly make use D 442
we commonly call this D 442
we honestly think that D 433
we rummaged over for D 432
we saturate time and D 424
we referred just now D 410
we imported last year D 404
we encamped here for D 392
we surveyed said that D 377
we exchanged hugs and D 366
we exported more than D 360
we anxiously wait for D 356
we painters call our D 350
we hunkered down and D 348
we bestowed upon them D 328
we conclude from fig D 322
we surveyed said they D 314
we launched into our D 300
we shuttled back and D 298
we anchored here they D 298
we anxiously look for D 296
we ardently wish that D 293
we exchanged news and D 288
we commonly know them D 286
we modestly think with D 272
we therefore took him D 266
we followed suit and D 260
we dismount from our D 250
we justices were doing D 242
we commonly look for D 224
we strolled back and D 218
we retreated into our D 218
we exported last year D 214
we desisted from our D 214

we launched into this D 208
we anxiously hope that D 207
we strolled from one D 206
we stripped down and D 204
we converse much with D 202
we therefore took this D 200
we therefore paid him D 196
we continue firm and D 196
we straggle from our D 190
we launched into one D 190
we commonly make any D 190
we commonly call death D 190
we commonly call his D 186
we anchored just off D 184
we squatted down and D 182
we speedily find that D 180
we snuggled into our D 176
we actually paid for D 172
we retreated from our D 170
we commonly find our D 170
we obviously have and D 168
we followed their cab D 168
we scurried away and D 166
we libations unto each D 154
we ardently wish may D 154
we invested more than D 152
we suddenly jerk our D 148
we imported into this D 148
we switched back and D 146
we oftenest meet with D 146
we nowadays take for D 146
we obviously have two D 144
we commonly take them D 144
we reviewed more than D 142
we finished curing all D 140
we reviewed what had D 138
we exported less than D 136
we ventured into this D 134
we scarcely ever met D 134
we narrowed down our D 134
we hereunto sign our D 134
we commonly call men D 134
we revolted from them D 130
we imported from them D 128
we commonly call its D 128
we therefore took all D 126
we mutually gave and D 126
we intended leaving his D 126
we commonly call him D 126
we obviously have that D 125
we manfully made our D 124
we disclaim also any D 124
we remained firm and D 122
we commonly used our D 122
we commonly think and D 122
we catholics hold that D 120
we ardently wish them D 120
we cordially wish him D 118
we children took our D 117
we required from art D 116
we oftenest meet are D 116

we baptized into one D 112
we averaged more than D 112
we ordinary folk can D 108
we commonly give our D 108
we cordially hope that D 107
we switched from one D 106
we organize work and D 106
we disengage from our D 106
we therefore aver for D 104
we squeezed into our D 104
we penalize those who D 104
we anchored next day D 104
we actually took off D 101
we servants were all D 100
we seesawed back and D 100
we received bread and D 100
we oftenest find men D 100
we shivered during two D 98
we ridicule those who D 98
we resolved upon going D 98
we anchored there for D 98
we banished from our D 97
we procured during our D 96
we mutually give and D 96
we commonly work with D 96

we can all sail D 44
we can all chat D 44
we met and held D 43
we got hit hard D 43
we did not rank D 43
we can git there D 43
we are all thine D 43
we are all firm D 43
we let each node D 42
we had our outing D 42
we get one shot D 42
we can now rank D 42
we met how much D 41
we met one more D 40
we had one mule D 40
we can now gaze D 40
we can not glue D 40
we ate off gold D 40

we are thrown against D 82
we are talking millions D 82
we are talking figures D 82
we are still tainted D 82
we are loyal members D 82
we are given license D 82
we are again settled D 82
we had taken luncheon D 80
we can march against D 80
we are tired because D 80
we are still indulging D 80
we are quite overrun D 80
we met again outside D 57
we had waved goodbye D 46
we saw smoke ascending D 45
we had thrice invoked D 43
we may again suspect D 41
we can easily restate D 41
we are bound because D 41
we are short sighted D 40

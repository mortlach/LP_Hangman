we address the theoretical D 80
we acquire the requisite D 80
we crossed the intervening D 60
we suppose the aggregate D 59
we dropped the subscript D 59
we compute the resultant D 50
we present an optimized D 44
we entered the refectory D 44
we started by starlight D 41
we entered the submarine D 41
we express the objective D 40

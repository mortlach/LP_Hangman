were big clouds rolling D 90
were being tossed aside D 90
weep for another sword D 90
weary and sleepy after D 90
wearing that yellow dress D 90
wearing his little black D 90
wealth and income while D 90
were two double doors D 88

wearing long rubber boots D 86
wearing his famous white D 86

west and jasper chase D 84
were two regions where D 84
were then smarting under D 84
were then ground smooth D 84
were set ablaze while D 84
were now stowed under D 84
were not firmly under D 84
were not drawings which D 84
were not bullet proof D 84
were not always frank D 84

wearing his sacred robes D 80
were too highly strung D 63

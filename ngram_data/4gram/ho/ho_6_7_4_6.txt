honest triumph over unjust M 216
honest persons were misled M 80
hoarse cadence lull seafaring D 222
homely couches know broken D 153
horses stamped their hooves D 152
hotter spirits have thought D 134
horror because their swarthy D 124
hovers between three periods D 123
houses carried into effect D 120
hourly venture life should D 114
honour derived from imposing D 98
horses carried their riders D 96
houses perform their clumsy D 86
hoarse whisper from behind D 86
honest patriots were forced D 82
hollow murmurs from behind D 54

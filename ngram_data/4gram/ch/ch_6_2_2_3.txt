chilly to be out D 42
cheaper in the one D 42
chasms in the sun D 42
changes in the pop D 42
chairs of the mid D 42
chiefs in the mid D 41
chewed in the east D 41
cheers me up with D 41
charts is the one D 41
charge in the van D 41
charge at the peak D 41
chanting of the poem D 41
chalet on the top D 41
chairs of the six D 41
chokes up the air D 40
choice of the ice D 40
chilling in the air D 40
charms me in this D 40
chapel of the now D 40
changes in the dew D 40
chancing to be out D 40
chairs in the inn D 40

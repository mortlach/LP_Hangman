its hues like velvet D 82
its hind legs across D 82
its cues from nature D 82
its cash flow through D 82
its three tall towers D 80
its rich wood paneling D 80

its guns were spiked D 80
its deep blue petals D 80
its bold deep hollow D 80
its prey from behind D 63
its eyes were sunken D 51
its axis pass through D 40

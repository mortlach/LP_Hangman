its disk drives and D 86
its biting satire and D 86
its best fruits are D 86
its wide arches and D 84
its ward surgeon and D 84
its seats filled with D 84
its safe harbor and D 84
its ruling family had D 84
its only rivals being D 84
its neck around and D 84
its most recent war D 84

its only allies and D 82
its most native and D 82
its more tender and D 82
its lost status and D 82
its last shriek and D 82
its last golden age D 82
its last fruits are D 82
its gray houses and D 82
its eyes glared and D 82
its damp tangles and D 82
its very embers and D 80
its true extent can D 80
its star system and D 80
its sole duties are D 80
its rich carved and D 80
its rays bouncing off D 80
its only outlet for D 80
its moat filled with D 80
its main outlet for D 80
its love scenes and D 80
its laws accord with D 80
its iron strength had D 80

its full height but D 80
its full extent all D 80
its blue velvet box D 80
its huge dorsal fin D 52

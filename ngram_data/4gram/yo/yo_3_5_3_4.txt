you would not spring D 43
you gotta lay down D 43
you fancy that even D 43
you wanna get shot D 42
you could hop over D 42
you would not pine D 41
you wanna get down D 41
you offer them cheap D 41
you could see rock D 41
you could get gold D 41
yon would not think D 41
you would then list D 40
you could see deer D 40

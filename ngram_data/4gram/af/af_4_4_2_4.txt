afar drag the slow M 1423
afar into the wood M 468
afar into the land M 366
afar from the land M 234
afar from the city M 124
afar have we come M 119
afar from the other M 109
afar till we were M 104
afar over the blue M 99
afar from the great M 84
afar into the deep M 49
afar over the wide M 44

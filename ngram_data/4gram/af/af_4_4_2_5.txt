afar from the waste M 560
afar came the sound M 428
afar from the civic M 254
afar from the world M 152
afar into the night M 114
afar over the hills M 110
afar over the leaves M 106
afar upon the naked M 102
afar among the hills M 97
afar from the field M 88
afar from the noise M 82
afar over the plain M 57
afar away the light M 40
afar from the shore D 258
afar over the level D 167
afar came the faint D 118
afar over the mists D 87

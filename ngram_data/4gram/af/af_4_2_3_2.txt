afar to see the M 631
afar to hear the M 281
afar he saw the M 264
afar to see it M 191
afar we saw the M 136
afar we hear the M 136
afar to see if M 124
afar the cry of M 112
afar the eye of M 94
afar the day of M 84
afar by all the M 83
afar in all the M 80
afar as one of M 49
afar to vex me D 106
afar the din of D 84

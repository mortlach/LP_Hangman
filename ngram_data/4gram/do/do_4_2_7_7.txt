down the moonlit streets D 41
down the freeway towards D 41
down the endless flights D 41
down the central meridian D 41
down the bulkhead between D 41
down by student strikes D 41
down to scratch himself D 40
down the streets dressed D 40
down the rivalry between D 40
down the oviduct towards D 40
down the outside diameter D 40
down the harsher aspects D 40
down the bridges between D 40

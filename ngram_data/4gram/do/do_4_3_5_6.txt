down his tawny cheeks D 83
down new gaunt street D 82
down her livid cheeks D 82
down and gazed around D 82
dost thou glide before D 82
door and leaned through D 82
done with razor blades D 82
doll its first feature D 82
down our roman friend D 80
down his fishing tackle D 80
down her feather duster D 80
down and thinly strewn D 80
done with digging sticks D 80
down with drawn swords D 74
down his chest toward D 69
down and drove through D 65
down her ivory cheeks D 61
down you dirty rascal D 60
down his right forearm D 59
down and rolling around D 55
down oak creek canyon D 54
down his chest before D 54
down his throat almost D 52
down and gazed across D 51
down with fever before D 50
down his seamed cheeks D 50
down his burning cheeks D 49
down and built houses D 49
down with brass screws D 48
down its throat without D 48
down his throat instead D 48
down her throat through D 48
dost thou exert thyself D 48
down one level further D 47
down his pants before D 47
down for fifty pounds D 47
down and shining through D 47
down our front stairs D 46
down and start shooting D 45
down his right sleeve D 43
down her dusky cheeks D 43
down and raced across D 43
down and paged through D 43
down and began twisting D 43
dost thou boast thyself D 43
down with every breeze D 42
down its serial number D 42
down and began dragging D 42
dogs are panting around D 42
down for pilot training D 41
down and start drinking D 41
down and raced toward D 40
down and build bigger D 40
door and dived inside D 40

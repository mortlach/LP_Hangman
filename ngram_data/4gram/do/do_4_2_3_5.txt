down on this ledge D 43
down on its throat D 43
down on its pivot D 43
down on his cabin D 43
down on her stiff D 43
down in this basin D 43
down at his tired D 43
down at his soggy D 43
down at his plump D 43
down at his court D 43
down at her blank D 43
down as they crept D 43
down as she raced D 43
doting on her child D 43
door of his adobe D 43
down to thin edges D 42
down to its perch D 42
down to its heels D 42
down to its bosom D 42
down to her folks D 42
down the icy rocks D 42
down the bed sheet D 42
down the air strip D 42
down the air lanes D 42
down on you knees D 42
down on its metal D 42
down on her scalp D 42
down in his plush D 42
down at her horse D 42
down at her cabin D 42
down as you slide D 42
dose is one fourth D 42
down to two packs D 41

down on his plump D 41
down on his bureau D 41
down my raw throat D 41
down in our hotel D 41
down in its stall D 41
down as his tongue D 41
down as his chief D 41

down on his dusty D 40
down of all racial D 40
down in his villa D 40
down in her porch D 40
down at his pudgy D 40
down at her toast D 40
down at her silky D 40
door if they would D 40

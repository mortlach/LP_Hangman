wring the neck of D 6788
wring the heart of D 1765
wring it from the D 528
wring it from me D 350
wring as much as D 324
wring my neck if D 282
wring the hand of D 236
wring my heart to D 164
wring the soul of D 124
wring the heart to D 98
wring the heart in D 96
wring my heart by D 92
wring the nose of D 90
wring my heart as D 41

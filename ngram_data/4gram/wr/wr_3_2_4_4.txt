wring the truth from D 1802
wring the last drop D 1444
wring my very heart D 319
wring my neck like D 304
wring the most from D 240
wring the last hard D 174
wring the tears from D 166
wring my heart when D 144
wring no more from D 128
wring as much from D 128
wring the life from D 112
wring the sweat from D 106
wring the very last D 100
wring the very heart D 98
wring the last cent D 82

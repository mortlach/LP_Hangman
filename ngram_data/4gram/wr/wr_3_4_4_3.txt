wring your neck for D 818
wring your heart yet D 378
wring tears from his D 218
wring your neck and D 210
wring your heart with D 208
wring your lips out D 154
wring your neck with D 148
wring tears from him D 142
wry face when she D 134
wring their heads off D 109
wring your heart and D 108
wring some meaning out D 85

wring from the soil D 472
wring from the poor D 178
wry face on hearing D 176
wring from it some D 134
wring from the other D 122
wring from the lips D 118
wring from the most D 114
wring from the pity D 104
wring from the very D 103
wring from the heart D 102
wring from the land D 100
wry face he made D 98
wring from the pope D 88

wrap your hands around M 1282
wrap their minds around M 1183
wrap your brain around M 621
wrap your cloak around M 554
wrap their tails around M 422
wrap their hands around M 260
wrong from growing larger M 234
wrong turn after another M 172
wrong many times before M 138
wrong will right itself M 108
wrap many times around M 104
wrong move could result M 100
wrap their lives around M 86
wrap your fingers around D 1599
wringing their hands before D 326
wrong word would incite D 246
wrap your tongue around D 192
wrap their fingers around D 168
writ very large indeed D 167
wrung from warring nations D 140
wrap your shawl closer D 114
wrap your thumbs around D 85

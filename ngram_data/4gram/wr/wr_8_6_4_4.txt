wrenched myself away from M 438
wrenched itself free from M 296
wrenched itself away from M 272
wrenched myself free from M 264
wrenches itself away from M 138
wretches should have been M 106
wretched little arms like M 98
wretched little ones were M 84
wrenches itself free from M 82
wretched victim were heard M 80
wrinkles around your eyes D 465
wrinkles around their eyes D 292
wretched cabins were wide D 216
wrinkles around your mouth D 117
wrinkled before their time D 90
wretched slaves into those D 90
wretched owners flew from D 90

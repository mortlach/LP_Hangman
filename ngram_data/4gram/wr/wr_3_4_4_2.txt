wring tears from the D 810
wring your neck if D 564
wry face over the D 496
wry face when he D 488
wry face over it D 474
wring gold from the D 360
wring tears from me D 334
wring some sort of D 192
wring some kind of D 188
wring pity from the D 160
wring more from the D 147
wring your neck as D 143
wry face from the D 134
wry face when the D 120
wring meaning from the D 96
wring peace from the D 86

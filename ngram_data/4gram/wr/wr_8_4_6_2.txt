wreckage left behind by M 538
wriggled back through the M 172
wretches whom neither the M 168
wriggled away through the M 136
wretches were forced to M 136
wretches will become at M 96
wretched mass should be M 92
wretches were unable to M 86
wreckage were picked up M 84
wrinkled face seemed to D 430
wretched fags nearest at D 164
wrinkles were pursed as D 160
wrinkled from sleeping in D 142
wrinkled face wreathed in D 134
wrinkled skin around the D 132
wrinkled face framed by D 104
wrinkled face showed no D 84
wrinkled face looked as D 59

evidence that supports a M 3778
evidence that suggests a M 3346
evolution has produced a M 1516
evidence that provides a M 926
everyone who receives a M 842
everyone who received a M 828
everyone was assigned a M 712
evolution has provided a M 384
evolution has followed a M 348
everyone had expected a M 340
everyone has received a M 326
everyone had received a M 316
evidence that confirms a M 298
evidence has provided a M 296
evolution had produced a M 246
evidence thus suggests a M 232
evidence and provides a M 218
everyone can remember a M 218
evidence bag containing a M 196
evidence that whenever a M 184
evidence now suggests a M 184
evolution has involved a M 178
everyone who attended a M 176
evidence that requires a M 162
evidence now supports a M 162
evidence and produced a M 156
everyone who occupies a M 154
everyone who performs a M 146
evolution has retained a M 132
evidence has produced a M 128
evolution and provides a M 126
evidence and rendered a M 120
everyone who operates a M 114
everyone who develops a M 114
evidence and presents a M 106
everyone has observed a M 104
evidence for supporting a M 102
evidence and suggests a M 102
evaluating and developing a M 100
evidence and therefore a M 98
evidence and requires a M 98
evidence and returned a M 94
evaluating and monitoring a M 94
evidence and received a M 92
evidence and prepared a M 90
everyone can identify a M 90
everyone who conquers i M 88
everyone has acquired a M 84
evolution that provides a M 80
evidence and proposed a M 80
evidence that specific t M 54
evidence does indicate a D 368
evidence may indicate a D 282
evidence that warrants a D 148
evidence that indicate a D 104

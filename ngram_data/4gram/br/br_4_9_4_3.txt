break precisely over one M 117
breath proceeded from his M 102
brings separation from god M 80
bred pugnacity into our D 484
bringing organisms into new D 296
breath whispered over her D 242
breath freshener into his D 142
bred community like this D 136
bringing torrential rain and D 114
bringing physiology into its D 106
breath shuddered from her D 96
bringing ourselves into due D 84
bringing discredit upon his D 82

breakfast there every morning M 288
branches from nearby trees M 276
breakfast here every morning M 126
branches were still green M 126
brilliant work which began M 112
branches were bending under M 100
branches bearing small leaves M 88
breathless just thinking about M 86
branches from which arise M 86
branches when strong winds D 292
branches were swaying about D 250
branches from fruit trees D 204
breakdown into amino acids D 178
breakfast tray every morning D 157
brighter eyes never beamed D 122
brotherly love which ought D 110
brighter aerial world again D 110
branches like shaking hands D 96
brigades were named after D 82
branches kingly eagles perch D 58

brooded over this dream D 82
brogues tied with thongs D 82
breakers flying ten feet D 82
branded those who were D 82
brought home for sale D 81
brushed over his skin D 80
brushed from his mind D 80
brought over two mugs D 80
brothers rose and went D 80
bristling like two dogs D 80
brethren were dead leaving D 80
breezes warm and free D 80
breeder will not have D 80
brought back any news D 58
brocade shot with gold D 58
bruised face and body D 53
briefly took his eyes D 52
brethren those who have D 51
briefly took her hand D 50
bruised pain all over D 48
brushes away her tears D 47
brought back his foot D 47
brethren here and there D 47
brethren call him fool D 43
brought back his soul D 42
brethren more and more D 42
brought back his gaze D 41
bronzed skin and dark D 41
brethren were not slow D 41
brethren love each other D 40
breakage here and there D 40
bracken here and there D 40

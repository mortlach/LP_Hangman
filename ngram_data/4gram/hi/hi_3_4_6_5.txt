his eyes became fiery D 56
his arms fondly round D 54
his love without alloy D 52
his more gifted rival D 47
his five little trading D 46
his arms firmly round D 46
his much younger rival D 45
his high backed leather D 44
his eyes become tired D 44
his wall street banking D 43
his diary quoted above D 43
his most recent stage D 42
his hand curved round D 42
his great french rival D 42
his chin barely above D 42
his rude dialect calls D 41
his high school plays D 41
his face turned chalk D 41
his face becoming livid D 41
his wife turned round D 40
his nose seemed longer D 40
his desk before seven D 40

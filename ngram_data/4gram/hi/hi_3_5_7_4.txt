his blood gurgled down D 84
him which evinced high D 84
his fingers clamped over D 83
his whole progeny must D 82
his voice matched hers D 82
his sword wrested from D 82
his staff members from D 82
his small oblique eyes D 82
his rapid passage from D 82
his poetry flashes from D 82
his newly trimmed hair D 82
his mother knocked down D 82
his large haggard eyes D 82
his knees together like D 82
his knees buckled when D 82
his first sojourn here D 82
his first national radio D 82
his first musical love D 82
his first inquiry when D 82
his first election having D 82
his fingers clasped hers D 82
his fatal gospels into D 82
his chief victims were D 82
his brows lowered over D 82
his action hastens into D 82
his whole brigade were D 80
his white pointed teeth D 80
his white flannel gown D 80
his social position must D 80
his social function will D 80
his small stature when D 80
his small reddish eyes D 80
his small pointed nose D 80
his power crumbling away D 80
his pants pockets were D 80
his noble stanzas tell D 80
his naval service bill D 80
his leather satchel from D 80
his first attempt took D 80
his fingers together when D 80
his fingers drummed upon D 80
his erect carriage made D 80
his chief virtues were D 80
his bride arrived from D 80
his blood drained away D 80
his black doublet down D 80
his shirt sleeves down D 56
his father slumped over D 47
his fingers stroked down D 46
his social position more D 44
his horse dropped down D 44
his fingers pressed down D 44
his field glasses down D 44
his breast against hers D 44
him sitting hunched over D 44
his party floated down D 43
his horse plodded along D 43
his brows snapped down D 43
his books include race D 43
his social studies test D 42
his shirt halfway down D 41
his lower eyelids down D 41
his hands stuffed down D 41
his hands gripped hard D 41
his fingers skimmed down D 41
his shirt slipped down D 40
his fingers feathered over D 40

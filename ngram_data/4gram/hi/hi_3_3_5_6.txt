his long tramp through D 82
his long tramp across D 82
his long blond lashes D 82
his head nearly brushing D 82
his eye began watering D 82
his death would arrive D 82
his dear sword reposing D 82
his being would become D 82
his art could effect D 82
him with fresh forces D 82
him who never sinned D 82
him that still lingered D 82
him for money loaned D 82
him for every morsel D 82
him and spoke almost D 82
his zeal shews itself D 80
his red scarf around D 80
his pen might remain D 80
his own vague notions D 80
his own social powers D 80
his own lyric genius D 80
his own green shoots D 80
his own comic genius D 80
his own coins minted D 80
his old tutor bishop D 80
his old corps whether D 80
his new social milieu D 80
his long knife poised D 80
his lip still curled D 80
his job would entail D 80
his head after dinner D 80
his fat fingers around D 80
his big hands stroking D 80
him who would assert D 80
him who speaks softly D 80
him then grows pungent D 80
him she would resist D 80
him his water bottle D 80
him for throwing stones D 80
him and would suffer D 80
him and would almost D 80
him and spoke before D 80
his new found orchid D 71
hit that magic number D 61
his low stone dwelling D 57
him for fooling around D 54
him for lagging behind D 52
his red light flashing D 49
his own party caucus D 46
his own field dressing D 46
his own mount around D 41
his long fingers inside D 41
him for every shilling D 41
his car right through D 40

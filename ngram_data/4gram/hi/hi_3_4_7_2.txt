his camp according to D 80
his body tensely on D 80
his body shivering as D 80
his best manners to D 80
him such morsels of D 80
him some vestige of D 80
him pull trigger on D 80
him most cruelly to D 80
him into corners to D 80
his gaze traveling up D 72
his heavy glasses up D 56
his eyes latched on D 56
his feet swelled up D 53
his body floated up D 53
his mouth pinched in D 52
his wife arrived as D 51
his wife brought on D 50
his diary entries as D 49
his hand sharply up D 47
his face pinched up D 47
hit list because of D 45
his mouth latched on D 45
him from boyhood as D 45
his young hostess as D 44
his hips forward so D 44
his hair ruffled up D 44
his hair cropped as D 44
his early paintings as D 44
his army marched as D 44
his lips screwed up D 42
his face painted as D 42
his body hunched up D 42
him five shillings as D 42
his wife stepped on D 41
his nose pinched in D 41
his mouth fastening on D 41
his face smashed up D 41
his early prowess as D 41
him into custody so D 41
his knee swelled up D 40
his hand snapped up D 40

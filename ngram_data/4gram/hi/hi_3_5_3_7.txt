his chest and pierced D 41
his change and receipt D 41
his voice was garbled D 40
his usual low whistle D 40
his throat and inhaled D 40
his telling and retelling D 40
his prose was flowery D 40
his knife and threatening D 40
his horse and scalped D 40
his groin and abdomen D 40
his footing and drowned D 40
his chest and temples D 40
his chest and smashed D 40
his charm and modesty D 40
him happy and relaxed D 40

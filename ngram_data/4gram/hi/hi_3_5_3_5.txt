his throat and vomit D 40
his throat and blows D 40
his teaching and editing D 40
his scrip and stick D 40
his peers and later D 40
his pants and hands D 40
his knees with either D 40
his grave this morning D 40
his fleet was either D 40
his fists and fight D 40
his dealings with woman D 40
his chest and walks D 40
his chest and moves D 40
his chest and below D 40
his chair and rolls D 40

his smile chilled her D 82
his sight because they D 82
his shirt spotted with D 82
his sharp profile and D 82
his rival offered two D 82
his rival brothers and D 82
his poker parties and D 82
his pleasing fictions are D 82
his parting gesture was D 82
his palms against them D 82
his older cousins and D 82
his mother spotted him D 82

his inner cabinet and D 82
his human features and D 82
his horse neighed and D 82
his hands twitching with D 82
his hands swollen with D 82
his hands smarted with D 82
his hands slender and D 82
his groin suffering him D 82
his grief forbade him D 82

his godly counsel and D 82
his gaunt admirer with D 82

his fingers knotted and D 82
his fingers between its D 82
his court together with D 82

his brute courage and D 82
his armor covered with D 82

him which clouded his D 82
him rather sternly for D 82
him whose servant you D 81
his voice steadier than D 80

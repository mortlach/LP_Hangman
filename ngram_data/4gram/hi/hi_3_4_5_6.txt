his brow would furrow D 86
his arms snaking around D 86
him there after dinner D 86
him some gnawing thought D 86
him like deacon walker D 86

his hearing would return D 84
his hand resting lovingly D 84
his half empty bottle D 84
his great white turban D 84
his good tweed jacket D 84
his gaze turning inward D 84
his full gaunt height D 84
his face would surely D 84

cry filled the air M 740
cry caught in her M 401
cry myself to death M 322
cry raised on this M 298
cry halves to any M 222
cry myself up for M 174
cry raised at this M 165
cry softly as she M 154
cry caught in his M 154
cry should be for M 140
cry reached the red M 104
cry behind me and M 88
cry lodged in her M 86
cry before we are M 86
cry loudly to god M 84
cry raised by all M 67
cry before it was M 62
cry raised by his M 51
cry itself to death M 48
cry through the long M 40
cry reached the ears D 328
cry reached my ears D 328
cry choked in his D 116
cry seemed to tear D 96

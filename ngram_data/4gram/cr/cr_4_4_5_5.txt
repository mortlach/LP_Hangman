crying just thinking about M 96
crying when mother leaves M 61
crop their waxen thighs D 1116
crew were still alive D 446
crop thine acres yield D 440
crag took human shape D 384
crew were never found D 170
cringe just thinking about D 144
crew were looking after D 124
crew were still working D 116
crew knew anything about D 114
crop will yield about D 108
crew were below decks D 100
crew were talking about D 94
crew were given shore D 91
crew were running about D 86
crew were lounging about D 82
cream three times daily D 62

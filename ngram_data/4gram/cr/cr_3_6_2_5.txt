cry through the night M 334
cry halves to anything M 294
cry amongst the people M 274
cry turned the blood M 170
cry across the water M 168
cry instead of laugh M 126
cry around the world M 120
cry sooner or later M 118
cry across the river M 98
cry filled the night M 88
cry before he could M 43
cry stanza my stone D 217
cry piercing the night D 100
cry stalks in broad D 96
cry amongst the folks D 90
cry behind the arras D 86

time literally stands still M 96
time developed powers which M 90
tiny particles called atoms D 2456
time intervals called slots D 280
till universal infamy shall D 246
till exhausted nature could D 178
time immemorial rubbed smooth D 110
time inhabited places would D 98
tiny scattered lights began D 93
time triggered duties under D 90
tiny particles called genes D 86

is due tomorrow morning M 230
is this isolation which M 228

is his deadliest enemy M 220
is being acquired under M 220
is being achieved under M 220
is too narrowly drawn M 218
is thus rendered still M 218
is that business ethics M 218

is thus rendered quite M 212
is this affection which M 212

is not withdrawn within M 212
is not ordinary water M 212
is not describing anything M 212

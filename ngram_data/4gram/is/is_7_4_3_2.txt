islands rising out of D 1740
islands will not be D 1214
isotope data for the D 1205
islands there are no D 1160
islands there was no D 801
islands rise out of D 774
islands were not to D 692
islands form one of D 573
islands were not the D 550
islands along with the D 531
islands were not so D 510
islands other than the D 483
islands were one of D 462
islands just east of D 445
islands were for the D 404
islands were not in D 364
islands there may be D 351
islands rose out of D 340
isotope ratio for the D 282
isotope ratio can be D 282
islands have one of D 282
issuers will not be D 278
islands show that the D 278
islands have had to D 272
islands must not be D 255
isotope ratio and the D 220
isotope data and the D 216
islands there are in D 216
islands have had the D 208
islands were out of D 206
islands were not as D 190
isolate what may be D 182
islands need not be D 182
isotope data can be D 175
isolate from all the D 172
islands were going to D 172
isotope used and the D 160
islands were off the D 160
islands there are on D 159
isolating those who do D 158
islands were hit by D 158
islands lies off the D 142
islands have led to D 140
islands from out of D 136
islands were not of D 134
isolate just one of D 132
islands from east to D 132
islands were now in D 126
islands very near to D 126
isotope used for the D 123
islands have had an D 122
isotherm data for the D 121
islands there was an D 120
islands from that of D 120
isolate only one of D 118
islands meant that the D 118
islands from end to D 118
issuers other than the D 114
islands more than the D 114
islands there are the D 110
islands were then in D 106
islands came with the D 106
islands were near the D 104
islands were near by D 104
islands very near the D 98
isolate those with the D 96
isotope scan may be D 92
islands gave way to D 92
islands well out in D 91
islands were not on D 90
islands means that the D 90
islands there was the D 88
isolate from that of D 87
islands have yet to D 86
islands have not the D 86
islands have all the D 86
islands from ten to D 84
isotope ratio may be D 83
islands what had the D 82
isolate only one or D 81
islands come and go D 47
isotherm data can be D 46
isomers other than the D 45
isolate from each of D 43
isotope need not be D 40

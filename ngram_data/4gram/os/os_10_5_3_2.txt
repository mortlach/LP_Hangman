ostensible reason for the D 9338
ostensible reason was to D 1302
ostensible reason was the D 1070
ostensible cause was the D 706
ostensibly working for the D 592
oscillator which can be D 490
oscillation which can be D 488
oscillator model for the D 471
ostensible cause for the D 426
ostensible reason for my D 378
ostensible reason that the D 338
oscillation turns out to D 306
oscillation period and the D 291
ostensible reason why the D 262
ostensible basis for the D 254
ostensibly waiting for the D 250
ostensibly bound for the D 244
ostensible reason for it D 236
oscillation which may be D 230
oscillator which may be D 226
ostensible reason that he D 222
oscillator makes use of D 210
ostensible issue was the D 188
oscillator model can be D 188
oscillation period for the D 173
oscillation could not be D 168
ostensibly given for the D 158
ostensible reason being the D 154
oscillation would not be D 154
oscillation period can be D 140
oscillates round that of D 140
ostensibly looking for the D 132
oscillation which has the D 130
ostensible basis may be D 126
ostentation rather than of D 122
oscillation modes can be D 118
ostensible reason being to D 116
oscillator model and the D 116
ostensibly setting out to D 106
oscillator rather than an D 106
ostensible reason that it D 104
ostensible agent for the D 102
ostensible reason for so D 100
oscillation rather than of D 100
ostensibly speaking for the D 96
ostensible reason why he D 96
oscillator shows that the D 94
ostensible cause being the D 92
ostensible rather than the D 90
ostensible reason was an D 84
oscillator would not be D 84
oscillator model with the D 50
oscillator power can be D 43

sun stands still upon M 394
sun standing still upon M 362
sun turned black like M 349
sun already stood high M 184
sun through heaven once M 170
sun should never rise M 146
sun around which other M 138
sun appears again upon M 132
sun standing still over M 125
sun became black like M 95
sun passes round from M 82
sun should shine upon D 618
sun shines today also D 482
sung through every land D 242
sun itself would have D 164
sun shines alike upon D 144
sun coursing level along D 136
sun shines after rain D 122
sun shines right into D 116
sun already shining into D 102
sun itself would grow D 98
sun always shine upon D 82

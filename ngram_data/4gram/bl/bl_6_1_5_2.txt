blazed a trail of D 2770
blazed a trail in D 1788
blazed a trail to D 1452
blacks a sense of D 826
blazed a trail by D 310
bleeds a nation to D 246
blazed a trail up D 191
blacks a share of D 188
blacks a voice in D 174
blacks a right to D 152
blazed a trail on D 142
blacks a place in D 136
blends a sense of D 135
blazes a trail of D 131
blazes a trail to D 130
blazed a trail as D 130
blacks a stake in D 124
blanch a pound of D 113
blazes a trail in D 112
blacks a feeling of D 106
blinds a mother to D 94
blazed a trail the D 92
blocking a piece of D 82

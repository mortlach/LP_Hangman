blessedness there is in M 264
blessedness lies in the M 208
blessedness must be the M 192
blessedness will be the M 90
blunderbuss down at the D 240
blasphemers were to be D 238
bloodthirsty fury of the D 158
blindfolded most of the D 157
blockhouses were to be D 146
blasphemous hymn of the D 140
blackguards seem to me D 140
blasphemous oaths of the D 114
bloodhounds were at my D 106
bloodthirsty gods of the D 98
bloodthirsty rage of the D 96
bloodhounds were on the D 94
bloodthirsty beast of the D 90
bloodstains were on the D 86
bloodstains left by the D 80

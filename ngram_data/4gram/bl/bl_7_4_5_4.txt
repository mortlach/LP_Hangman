blessings from heaven upon M 344
blocked from entry into M 284
blocked their entry into M 268
blessed many times over M 263
blessed time shall come M 254
blessed eyes breed such M 132
blessings from every part M 126
blocked from reaching their M 118
blessed land where there M 110
blessed days might come M 110
blocked from getting into M 104
blocked time after time M 94
blossom must needs come M 92
blessings were often like M 92
blessed lord never shed M 90
blinded soon after birth M 88
blessed days which ever M 88
blocked what might have M 86
blasted from solid rock D 417
blinked back fresh tears D 246
blooded boys feeling very D 196
blessed lord would have D 194
blessings were heaped upon D 148
blessed beams turns into D 146
blocked what would have D 116
blanket coat drawn over D 116
blended more easily into D 110
blinked away fresh tears D 106
blessed seed thereof sown D 106
blessed city shine upon D 102
blooded male would have D 100
blasted these thirty years D 94
blankly into space like D 92
blunder from which many D 46
blasted into solid rock D 44

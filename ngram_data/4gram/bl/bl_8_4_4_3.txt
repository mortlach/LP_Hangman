bleakness came into his M 166
blossoms were gone and M 96
blankets over your head D 230
blankets were used for D 226
blankets were laid out D 200
blustering over there and D 192
blankets away from her D 186
bludgeons came down and D 174
blanches your lips and D 150
blunders were made and D 148
blankets back over her D 144
blankets were warm and D 130
blankets away from him D 122
blackening their teeth and D 112
blisters break open and D 106
blankets away from his D 106
blankets from their own D 104
blunders will pass for D 96
blankets down here and D 92
blanched face from his D 88
blackening their teeth with D 82
blankets back over his D 80

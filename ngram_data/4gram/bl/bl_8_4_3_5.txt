blossoms have long since M 132
blossoms open and again M 116
blossoms tied with white M 104
blossoms open and close M 51
blockade during and after D 1052
blighted areas and slums D 901
blunders upon and gives D 232
blighted heart hath known D 226
blossoms pink and white D 182
blissful peace and quiet D 152
blustery wind was blowing D 150
blankets from him madly D 130
blankets over and under D 128
blustering wind was blowing D 122
blossoming pink and white D 114
blackest will thus crawl D 112
blubbering over his still D 104
bloodier wars than anything D 96
bluebird note this morning D 92
blankets over our faces D 92
blighted their own lives D 86
blotched skin was drawn D 80
blockading army had taken D 40

blossoms which covered the M 84
blackout period applies as D 212
blotched glass between the D 132
blundering piety reminds us D 126
blankets which covered the D 120
blindest shall foresee the D 114
blindingly white against the D 112
blackout period applies at D 112
blankets would conform to D 108
blackest marks against the D 108
blizzard raged outside the D 80

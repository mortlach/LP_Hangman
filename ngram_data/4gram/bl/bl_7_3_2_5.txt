bladder with the fingers D 48
blessed with the taste D 46
blossom with the fruit D 45
blended with the azure D 45
blended that the whole D 45
blasted out the front D 45
blotted out in smoke D 43
blanked out the whole D 43
blended with the newly D 42
blended with the nerve D 42
blurred that it could D 41
blended with the honey D 41
blankly out the front D 41
blurred and the world D 40
blooded than to quake D 40
blended with the vowel D 40
blended that it seems D 40
blanket and the water D 40

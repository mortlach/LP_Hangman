blossoms have all fallen M 90
blockade must not extend D 506
blundering into one another D 278
blossoming plum and cherry D 208
blundering their way through D 198
blighted fame and broken D 198
blankets were not enough D 152
blissful peace now appears D 144
blissful days and nights D 136
blankets waving and cracking D 124
blackest omen was gathering D 118
blankets were wet through D 114
blubbering over his master D 108
blockade along its shores D 106
blanched from his cheeks D 106
blissful halt was called D 100
blackish gray and opaque D 92
blighted hope nor broken D 88

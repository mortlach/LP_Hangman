she snatched her own D 88
she reserves all her D 88
she regarded them not D 88
she grimaced and put D 88
she grappled with his D 88
she entreated her not D 88
she chuckled and her D 88
she caresses her own D 88
she agitates one for D 88
shoe salesman and his D 86
she upbraiding them with D 86
she surmised that his D 86
she squeezed with her D 86
she smothered them with D 86
she shrugged and they D 86
she shrugged and led D 86
she shivered and let D 86
she scrubbed them with D 86
she reviewed all her D 86
she resented was not D 86
she resented being put D 86
she replaced her hat D 86
she promptly set out D 86
she plighted him her D 86
she insulted him and D 86
she clutched her arm D 86
she shrieked out her D 85
she trembles for her D 84
she trembled for joy D 84
she shivered with her D 84
she shivered and set D 84
she resented this easy D 84
she referred all her D 84
she rebuffed him and D 84
she rearranged her hat D 84
she invented for them D 84
she digested this for D 84
she ascribed all her D 84
she actually had sex D 84
she extended her thin D 83
she ventured out for D 82
she seconded with all D 82
she repulsed them with D 82
she reckoned that they D 82
she pretends that they D 82
she patently did not D 82
she embraces with her D 82
she detested this man D 82
she converts that sin D 82
she complied with them D 82
she animated both her D 82
she accosted him thus D 82
she accorded him her D 82
she adjusted her wig D 81
she trembled and then D 80
she suspects that one D 80
she snatched him out D 80
she reproved her own D 80
she rejoiced with all D 80
she inflamed them with D 80
she crippled this one D 80
she betrayed her real D 80
she snatched him off D 62
she escorted him out D 51
she ventured too near D 49
she reviewed all that D 47
she squeezed her own D 41

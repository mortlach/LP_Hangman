shoulders slumped with fatigue D 254
shouldest receive him forever D 250
sharpened pencils with erasers D 230
shoulders dressed with diamonds D 162
sheltered valleys and ravines D 134
shoulders rounded and hunched D 130
shepherds resumes his artless D 118
shattered fortune and decayed D 116
shortened muscles and tendons D 101
shoulders drooped with fatigue D 100
sharpened slander and doubled D 88
shoulders together and shivering D 86

she found his rhythm D 80
she found her sight D 80
she feels her pulse D 80
she drove for miles D 80
she drive her piles D 80
she could not allay D 80
she clasp her hands D 80
she asked him dryly D 80
she asked him coyly D 80
she would then point D 55
she would cut loose D 50
she found her grave D 48
she urged her steed D 47
she swept her skirt D 47
she waves and calls D 46
she spins and spins D 46
she baked her first D 46
she shook her locks D 45
she honed her writing D 45
she could see molly D 45
she would then dress D 43
she would say right D 43
she could not lunch D 43
she would not grace D 42
she found her jewel D 42
she waved her plump D 41
she hires and fires D 41
she bends her thither D 41
she waved her scarf D 40
she spoke her father D 40
she spies her mother D 40
she could see auras D 40
she bathed her mother D 40

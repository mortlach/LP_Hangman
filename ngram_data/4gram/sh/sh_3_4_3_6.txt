she took her secret D 45
she heard her murmur D 45
she felt him recoil D 45
she felt her blouse D 45
she flung them around D 44
she gave him poison D 42
she made this avowal D 41
she heard her captor D 41
she felt her bowels D 41
she took her pretty D 40
she rode him harder D 40
she lost her infant D 40
she drew her pretty D 40

she just went nuts D 82
she kept leaning over D 81
she wore blue silk D 80
she took some beef D 80
she took down what D 80
she took away only D 80
she threw open wide D 80
she call hers when D 80
she also took good D 80
she took some rice D 50
she will ride over D 48
she must sink down D 48
she cast hers down D 48
she sunk into such D 46
she even took down D 45
she were gazing down D 44
she rode back down D 44
she must have gold D 43
she also took down D 43
she only clung more D 42
she must have tact D 42
she will sink down D 41
she heard jack call D 41
she even took over D 41
she swam once more D 40
she made more fuss D 40

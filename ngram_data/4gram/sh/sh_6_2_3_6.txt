shouting to you through D 82
shouting at her brother D 82
should eat our dinner D 82
should be too partial D 82
should be her policy D 82
shores as they passed D 82
shines in our memory D 82
sheets of this letter D 82
sharer of his better D 82
shandy to his brother D 82
shamed by his always D 82
shaken by any common D 82
shabby in our policy D 82
shrine as they passed D 81
showed in his solder D 81
shaken it off before D 81
shutting it off before D 80
shrine of his boyish D 80
showed no ill temper D 80
shouting to them across D 80
should be two million D 80
should be met unless D 80
should be met boldly D 80
shores of his little D 80
shoots of old plants D 80
shooting at our troops D 80
sheets as they issued D 80
shared by all lovers D 80
shaken by his various D 80
shafts of this family D 80
shadow of that virgin D 80
shipping at all seasons D 70
shiver as she turned D 66
shoots up and spreads D 58
shipping in this manner D 56
shines in its strength D 54
shocking to his family D 53
shoved the gun inside D 52
shaken up with finely D 51
shouting to his sister D 50
shopping to buy clothes D 50
shooting in new jersey D 48
shooting as they passed D 47
shipping to his credit D 47
shopping to buy something D 46
shooting in each broken D 46
shopping at its finest D 45
shooting or not shooting D 45
shares of each income D 45
shadow of its towering D 45
should we not derive D 44
shoots up its flames D 44
shines on and through D 44
shopping at our stores D 43

should be fed better D 42
shocking to her feelings D 42
shiver as she passed D 42
shedding of his sacred D 42
shower to get cleaned D 41
showed me his painting D 41
shouting as they worked D 41
shiver as she walked D 41
shaken to his marrow D 41
shaken by that thought D 41
should it lag behind D 40

awe comes over me M 300
awe stole over me M 192
awe arising from the M 156
awe stealing over my M 144
awe comes upon me M 140
awe steals over the M 134
awe comes over us M 122
awe spread over the M 118
awe comes over the M 112
awe takes care of M 102
awe every time he M 89
awe grief heard the M 45
awe steals over us M 41
awe crept over me D 624
awe falls upon me D 284
awe crept over us D 266
awe crept over the D 242
awe swept over the D 190
awe crept into the D 123
awe swept over me D 86
awe crept into my D 84

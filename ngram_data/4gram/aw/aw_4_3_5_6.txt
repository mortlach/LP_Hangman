away his money freely M 91
away with anything except M 90
away his legal rights M 90
away and began another M 90
away with short notice M 89
away its light covering M 89

away and washing dishes D 140
away but would return D 130
away and moped toward D 124
away and raced toward D 120
away with every breeze D 118
away with false notions D 114
away any given portion D 110
away with steady sweeps D 106
away and leaned toward D 106

away his horse without D 100
away any lingering traces D 99
away and leaned across D 98
away with paper towels D 96

away they would gallop D 94
away with burning cheeks D 90
away his dirty clothes D 90
away and raced across D 90
away two canoes without D 88
away and began fiddling D 88
away his fishing tackle D 87

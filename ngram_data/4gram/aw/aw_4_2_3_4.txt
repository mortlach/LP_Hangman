away by sir john D 102
away to our camp D 100
away to his bunk D 100
away the old glue D 100
away in his foot D 100
away by any mere D 100
awed by his fate D 98
away to his canoe D 98
away the lid from D 98
away on this tide D 98
away by any wave D 98
away at our soul D 98
away as she slid D 98
away to that spot D 96
away to our beds D 96
away the thin skin D 96
away is his soul D 96
away in two cars D 96
away in his teeth D 96
away in his jaws D 96
away the seal from D 94
away on his rosy D 94
away in this tiny D 94
away at its mouth D 94
away at his ribs D 94
away the top inch D 92
away the old rags D 92
away the gum from D 92
away the bad news D 92
away on his mere D 92
away in this mood D 92
away in its stead D 92
away in his flat D 92
away at his nose D 92
away at his drum D 92
away of ice from D 91
awed by her great D 90
away on his piano D 90
away the peak till D 88
away the bed from D 88
away in one shot D 88
away by his mania D 88
away at her task D 88
awed by new york D 86
away the sap from D 86
away on its tide D 86
away in that tiny D 86
awning of his tent D 84
away in his robe D 84
away in his camp D 84
away to bed early D 83
awning of that size D 82
awed by how well D 82
away to this spot D 82
away of dead skin D 82
away in his sins D 82
away in her pink D 82
away in her flat D 82
away in her diary D 82
away if she took D 82
away at this task D 82
away the wet sand D 80
away in his filing D 80
away at his clay D 80
away as they flew D 80
away as she rode D 80
away an iota from D 80
away in his palm D 47
away at his knee D 43
awed by his very D 42
awed at how much D 40
away at that rock D 40

awakened from his delusions M 80
awakened from his slumbers D 1054
awakened from its slumbers D 684
awakened from her slumbers D 374
awakened from his reveries D 260
awakened from our slumbers D 152
awakened from her restless D 102
awakened from that delicious D 100
awakened from his delirium D 86

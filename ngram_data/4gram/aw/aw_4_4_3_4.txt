away from that mouth D 80
away from that lamp D 80
away from its pins D 80
away from her milk D 80
away from our loving D 75
away from being shot D 65
away from his twin D 64
away from his teasing D 64
away from his bread D 61
away from her firm D 56
away from his card D 54
away from this giant D 53
away thick with fast D 52
away from its twin D 52
away dirt and other D 47
away from her prying D 45
away from her drug D 45
away from this firm D 42
away dirt and rock D 42
away from each wall D 41
away from his sand D 40

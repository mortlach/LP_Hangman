awe before the power M 326
awe around my image M 240
awe before the beauty M 190
awe should we adore M 119
awe before the altar M 108
awe before the world M 102
awe before the vision M 86
awe before the might M 86
awe before the glory M 86
awe before an image M 82
awe through the ranks D 176
awl through the leather D 116
awe before the throne D 100

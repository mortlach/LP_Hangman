away eastward and westward M 170
away disgust and weariness M 162
away everything and everyone M 135
away dignity and interest M 106
away freedom and humanity M 105
away quickly and silently M 94
away quietly and returned M 92
away between two soldiers D 200
awed silence that followed D 187
away towards our purposed D 168
away terrors and troubles D 151
away several old servants D 104
away rapidly with distance D 100
away grumbling and despairing D 86

away the sweat dripping D 90
away in your locker D 90
away in three places D 90
away in such regions D 90
away in some museum D 90
away by more recent D 90
away to your parish D 88
away the milk carton D 88
away the heavy stones D 88
away by more pressing D 88
away the tire tracks D 87
away to some desert D 86
away the thorn bushes D 86
away the post office D 86
away the dark stains D 86
away the clean plates D 86
away in their pocket D 86
away to play tennis D 84
away the sweat streaming D 84
away the only solace D 84
away the main pillar D 84
away on some island D 84
away at your income D 84
away at some places D 84
awed by what seemed D 82
away to their station D 82
away the more readily D 82
away in huge chunks D 82
away to some asylum D 80
away the time drinking D 52
away to some boarding D 45
away in their headlong D 45
away in some asylum D 43

ye that labour and D 30914
ye are bought with D 14663
ye that forget god D 3194
ye are cursed with D 2261
ye one another with D 1748
ye who listen with D 1114
ye who labour and D 974
ye being rooted and D 966
ye are better than D 829
ye are become dead D 619

ye are without old D 400
ye had better let D 290
ye not better than D 272
ye had better not D 244
ye that travel and D 242
ye not repent and D 242
ye may divine that D 236
ye who taught weak D 225

ye who govern this D 136
yea and winter with D 134
ye then agreed you D 134

ye are clothed with D 130
ye who forget god D 128
ye that better than D 128
ye are buried with D 120
ye are endued with D 112
ye may praise them D 106

ye did before you D 102
ye are pleased with D 102
yea and scarce our D 100
ye may better hear D 100

ye are rebels all D 91
ye who attend her D 90

ye are minded that D 90
ye are painting for D 88
ye who sorrow for D 86

ye had better wring D 84
ye can hardly see D 82
ye may attain that D 52
ye are standing this D 44

ye are entered into D 3284
ye did service unto D 704
ye pay tribute also D 292
ye who blindly seek D 290
ye may appoint over D 214
ye are severed from D 169
ye may divorce your D 165
ye both stretch your D 140
ye now wonders know D 122
ye may garnish your D 122
ye did decline from D 120
ye are puttering over D 120
ye are brought back D 120
ye may deplore your D 112
ye may witness unto D 108
ye had touched beast D 106
ye say wherein have D 80

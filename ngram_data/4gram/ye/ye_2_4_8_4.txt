ye have received your D 3830
ye have purified your D 3492
ye have received from D 772
ye have profaned among D 750
ye walk contrary unto D 482
ye were baptized into D 232
ye have departed from D 196
ye must consider there D 142
ye have suffered from D 132
ye have suffered like D 106
ye have declined from D 104
ye were redeemed from D 90
ye have forsaken your D 86
ye were backward when D 82
ye have bestowed upon D 82

yellow hair fell across M 98
yellow eyes were watching M 92
yellow arms were naught M 86
yellow plus blue equals M 80
yellow eyes half closed M 46
yellow crew were tumbling D 154
yellow foam when shaken D 152
yellow belt grew narrow D 142
yellow rays were blending D 116
yellow fungi like lemons D 116
yellow bees were flitting D 110
yellow wall rose behind D 98
yellow silt roll tumbling D 94

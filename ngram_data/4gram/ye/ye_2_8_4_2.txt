ye therefore wise as D 6116
ye therefore into the D 1776
ye baptized into the D 534
ye scarcely tell to D 372
ye diminish from it D 306
ye separate saith the D 274
ye received from us D 244
ye chattering apes of D 228
ye therefore unto the D 162
ye ransomed from the D 152
ye strictly keep the D 140
ye therefore wife as D 132
ye merciful even as D 120
ye therefore well to D 96
ye lonesome ones of D 93
ye renowned spot of D 92
ye remember when we D 86
ye baptised into the D 84

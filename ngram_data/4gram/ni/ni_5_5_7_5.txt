night after endless night M 233
night about fifteen miles M 179
night within fifteen miles M 158
night after several hours M 156
night could equally exist M 148
night birds stopped after M 124
night which pressed round M 90
night makes everything plain M 82
night telling stories about D 116
night shall utterly abase D 104

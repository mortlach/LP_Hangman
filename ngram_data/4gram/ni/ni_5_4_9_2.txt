night only prevented the M 138
night only instances of M 120
night till sometimes we M 118
night have commanded the M 118
night gone peacefully to M 96
night most certainly as M 90
night from somewhere in M 90
night much disturbed by M 88
night among themselves in M 86
night more difficult to M 82
night took possession of D 422
night soon overspread the D 298

night only checkered by D 106
night wind whispered in D 82
night like fireflies in D 82

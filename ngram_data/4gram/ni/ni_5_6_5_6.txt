night before falling asleep M 2291
night worrying about whether M 436
night without knowing whether M 348
night without falling asleep M 182
night should watch without M 152
night seemed short enough M 120
night without running lights M 94
night without passing through M 80
night without getting caught M 80
night without telling anyone D 292
night little fires blazed D 124
night breeze blowing through D 120
night before after supper D 112
night before after dinner D 112
night before still lingered D 110
night strange faces peeped D 106

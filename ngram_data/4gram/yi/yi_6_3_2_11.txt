yields thus the acceleration M 208
yields and the corresponding M 195
yields than the corresponding M 152
yielding them up voluntarily M 138
yields for the probability M 137
yields and the development M 136
yields and the possibility M 118
yields for the corresponding M 114
yields him the satisfaction M 94
yields and the relationship M 46
yields for the equilibrium D 125
yields than the conventional D 112
yields for the differential D 44

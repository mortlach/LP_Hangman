yielded too far to M 492
yielded him all the M 352
yielded his seat to M 338
yielded but for the M 328
yielded all that the M 318
yielded long ago to M 272
yielded thus far to M 236
yielded for fear of M 166
yielded his head to M 162
yielded them all the M 134
yielded all that it M 134
yielded was not to M 130
yielded all that he M 112
yielded and let the M 106
yielded with all the M 102
yielded his arm to M 96
yielded him for so M 94
yielded her seat to M 82
yielded one ton of D 162
yielded one iota of D 132
yielded its bed to D 122
yielded per ton of D 86
yielded his bed to D 82

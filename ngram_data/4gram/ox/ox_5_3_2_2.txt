oxide and in the D 783
oxide due to the D 692
oxide has to be D 640
oxide and at the D 620
oxide ions in the D 557
oxide out of the D 413
oxide and it is D 370
oxide than in the D 300
oxide may be the D 291
oxide and to the D 285
oxide gas in the D 282
oxide and on the D 280
oxide had to be D 261
oxide and by the D 258
oxide gas as an D 249
oxide ions of the D 240
oxide and up to D 224
oxide may be an D 195
oxide are to be D 186
oxide ions at the D 171
oxide was in the D 163
oxide and is the D 156
oxide gas is the D 152
oxide are in the D 148
oxide that it is D 130
oxide with up to D 129
oxide may be of D 106
oxide led to the D 106
oxide and so on D 96
oxide was to be D 93
oxide but it is D 92
oxide ore in the D 69
oxide one of the D 50
oxide gas to be D 50
oxide owing to the D 40

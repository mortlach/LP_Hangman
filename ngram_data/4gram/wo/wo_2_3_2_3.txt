woe for the earth M 209
woe then to them M 180
woe then to all M 148
woe and the joy M 130
woe was in her M 128
woe that he had M 116
woe for it this M 114
woe was it that M 112
woe then to him M 112
woe for the man M 94
woe for the day M 92
woe for the age M 90
woe that it was M 82
woe then to our M 80
woe with the weal D 150
woe doth he bring D 82

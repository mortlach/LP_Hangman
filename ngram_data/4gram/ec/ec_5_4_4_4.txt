echoes have died away M 444
echoes came back from M 433
echoes coming back from M 334
echoes died away among M 212
echoes died away when M 196
echoes have also been M 170
echoes from other poets M 168
echoes have been heard M 156
echoes come back from M 148
echoed over their heads M 118
echoes were sent back M 114
echoes have come down M 112
echoes from those past M 104
echoes sent back from M 102
echoes died away into M 100
echoed along those high M 92
echoed back from other M 88
echoes came back over M 84
echoes died away there M 80
echoes must have been M 43
echoes roll from soul D 2409
echoes roll away into D 256

echo with his begging M 212
echo his own words M 208
echo was its voice M 184
echo but are nearer M 182
echo with his cries M 156
echo had one failing M 154
echo day and night M 146
echo with her cries M 128
echo her own words M 94
echo with his voice M 93
echo with his glory M 82
echo with his snort D 630

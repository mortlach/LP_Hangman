luck which attended his M 304
lust after eternity and M 254
luck again attended him M 136
luck still followed him M 132
lull which followed this M 110
luck which attended him M 90
lurk where serpents are D 354
luck never deserted him D 242
lush green pastures and D 196
lust after eloquent and D 122
lungs would collapse and D 96

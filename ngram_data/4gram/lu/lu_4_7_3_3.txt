luck stories they all M 234
luck finally run out M 140
luck because you can M 136
luck because they are M 92
lungs receive our air D 1310
lungs screamed for air D 825
lungs because they are D 268
lunging forward with his D 186
lungs expanding with long D 176
lungs carried him off D 166
lungs straining for air D 146
lungs inflate with air D 146

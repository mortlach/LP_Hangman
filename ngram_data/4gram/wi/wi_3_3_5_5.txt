with his eighth grade D 45
with his talon hands D 44
with his bulging belly D 44
with that earthly dross D 43
with our bible study D 43
with one group serving D 43
with its smoking engine D 43
with that lower level D 41
with oil price rises D 41
with his paper skull D 41
with his hazel stick D 41
with that blase world D 40
with its white adobe D 40
with his whole torso D 40
with his rifle close D 40
with her white smock D 40

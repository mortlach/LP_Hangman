paradigm along with the D 94
palatine hill and of D 94
paradigm case being the D 93
patients were put at D 92
patients were doing as D 92
patients there are the D 92
patients having had an D 92
patients have two to D 92
passenger cars now in D 92
partially used can of D 92
partially true but it D 92
partially come out of D 92
parishes were not the D 92
parishes have not an D 92
parental bond with the D 92
parallel role for the D 92
pavement like that of D 90
patients will die at D 90
patients were dying at D 90
patients there for the D 90
patients paid for the D 90
patients find that by D 90
patients during each of D 90
patients died and in D 90
patients come for the D 90
paternal home with the D 90
pastimes more than the D 90
passenger fell out of D 90
partially true and the D 90
parallel line with us D 90
paradigm laid out in D 90
painters were apt to D 90
payments paid for the D 88
patients were met by D 88
patients must now be D 88
passenger must pay the D 88
passenger boat for the D 88
partially dealing with the D 88
parishes there was the D 88
parental dyad and the D 88
parasite more than the D 88
parallel form with the D 88
palpation will aid in D 88
palpable sign that the D 88
pavement from one of D 86
patients were doing so D 86
patients went out to D 86
patients react with the D 86
patients like this in D 86
patients have met the D 86
patience pays off in D 86
paternal role for the D 86
pastoral theme and the D 86
pastoral love for the D 86
pastoral life that he D 86
pastoral land use is D 86
partially torn off by D 86
partially also for the D 86
paradigm must not be D 86
painters have had an D 86
painters felt that the D 86
painters feel that the D 86
parallel those with the D 85
parallel from one of D 85
patients will thus be D 84
patients were now in D 84
patients were easy to D 84
patients pain may be D 84
patients most apt to D 84
pastures must not be D 84
pastured there for the D 84
pastoral work was the D 84
pastoral work and of D 84
passenger side seat of D 84
passenger side for me D 84
passable only for the D 84
partially open with the D 84
partially bent and the D 84
parental drug use is D 84
parental coping with the D 84
parallel goal was to D 84
parallel case that the D 84
pamphlet grew out of D 84
pamphlet giving all the D 84
pamphlet came out the D 84
paleness gave way to D 84
packaged food and the D 83
patriotic songs and in D 82
patients were new to D 82
patients must put on D 82
patients learn not to D 82
patients coming for the D 82
patients come and to D 82
patients break out of D 82
pathogens along with the D 82
pastoral care and is D 82
passable road for the D 82
parishes were for the D 82
parishes there may be D 82
parallel only with the D 82
parabola will not be D 82
palpable once but am D 82
palatine join with the D 82
patience wearing thin as D 81
patients will ask to D 80
patients were off the D 80
patients only one of D 80
patients meant that the D 80
patients having had no D 80
patients early and to D 80
pastures along with the D 80
pastoral care that he D 80
passenger mile and the D 80
passenger cars and is D 80
partially true but the D 80
partially from fear of D 80
parishes were not so D 80
painters were not to D 80
parallel also with the D 63
parasite drag due to D 59
patients from them as D 51
parallel axes and the D 49
palpated along with the D 49
patrician nose and the D 44
parishes were not as D 43
paraffin base oil of D 43
pamphlet sent out to D 43
pampered from head to D 43
patients have not as D 41
packaged food that is D 41
patients were going on D 40

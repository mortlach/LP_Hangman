say their final farewells M 392
say more about themselves M 292
saw your father yesterday M 272
say what comes uppermost M 252
say much about themselves M 246
saw some short amendment M 240
say what could recommend M 216
say nothing about themselves M 196
saw your mother yesterday M 196
say what comes naturally M 168
sat down again instantly M 166
sat there looking miserable M 148
sat down quite naturally M 130
say from facts disclosed M 124
sat there waiting patiently M 116
saw their ships destroyed M 106
say what seems necessary M 100
say nothing about ourselves M 98
sat there quite immovable M 98
saw your joint happiness M 96
saw your first interview M 90
say those which interfere M 88
saw their vital interests M 84
sat there looking thoughtful M 82
sat there every afternoon M 80
say more about ourselves M 63
saw their homes destroyed D 362
sat down quite exhausted D 220
saw their faces reflected D 218
saw nothing which indicated D 178
saw such broad downright D 170
say nothing about political D 144
saw their fatal weaknesses D 122
sat down quite contented D 121
saw their crops destroyed D 118
saw their hopes shattered D 116
saw their first television D 116
saw some mural monuments D 106
sang songs about happiness D 102
saw some fresh advantage D 98
sat down again hurriedly D 94
saw their wincing attitudes D 92
saw many rooms decorated D 82

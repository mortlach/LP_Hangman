sat down directly across M 697
sat down abruptly before M 465
say what strictly belongs M 422
sat down silently beside M 266
sat there silently watching M 212
sat down helpless before M 188
saw their enormous brother M 186
sat down directly behind M 175
saw poor children asleep M 166
sat down suddenly before M 162
saw these creatures kneeling M 152
saw some movement behind M 126
sat down suddenly beside M 123
saw their property values M 122
sad walk homeward through M 114
saw these strangers through M 112
saw these strangers depart M 108
saw what happened through M 104
sat down abruptly beside M 102
saw some distance before M 100
saw their churches closed M 92
saw their children become M 90
say what happened before M 87
saw their tranquil victim M 82
saw their children weekly M 53
saw what happened before M 46
sad time stretching before D 1006
sap from infected plants D 460
sat gazing straight before D 208
saw gold glittering around D 172
saw some scorpions fighting D 150
sat down fatigued behind D 140
saw those possible ducats D 130
sat gazing absently through D 128
saw five friendly colors D 122
saw some terrible sights D 118
saw many currents offering D 100
saw some dramatic changes D 96
sat down fiercely midway D 96
saw many beautiful places D 94
saw more splendid peaches D 86
sat upon polished stones D 86
sang upon recorded actions D 84
sang some agreeable psalms D 82

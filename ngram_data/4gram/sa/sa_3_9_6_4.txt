saw themselves without hope M 132
saw themselves forced into M 112
saw everybody standing there M 100
sat sleepless through many M 98
sat unusually silent during M 90
saw themselves hunted down M 87
say yesterday behind your M 86
saw themselves secure from M 80
sat diagonally across from D 376
say democracy infers such D 352
saw imaginary saints just D 156

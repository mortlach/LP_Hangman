saw in them evidences D 84
saw by our freshness D 84
sat or lay motionless D 84
sat in his waistcoat D 84
sat in his parliament D 84
sat as his assessors D 84
say to her governess D 82
saw the two skeletons D 82
saw it was fruitless D 82
saw in his opponents D 82
saw in his apartment D 82
sat in this apartment D 82
saw in his political D 81
say the old pamphlets D 80
say so with conviction D 80
saw the two cavaliers D 80
saw the old clergyman D 80
saw my own handwriting D 80
saw it was inscribed D 80
say it was downright D 44
say in our political D 42
saw in his proposals D 41

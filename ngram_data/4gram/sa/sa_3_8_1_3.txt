sat opposite a man M 232
saw suddenly a man M 150
say whatever i can M 132
sat silently a few M 128
say whatever i had M 118
say concerning a man M 114
say concerning a few M 92
saw underneath a being M 90
say whatever i say M 88
sat silently a long M 88
saw chickens a day D 216
sad civility i read D 156
say sixpence a day D 102

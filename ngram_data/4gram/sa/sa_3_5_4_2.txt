say hello over the D 138
saw springing from the D 138
say hello back to D 137
sat mingled among the D 136
saw mills were in D 135
say hello from the D 134
saw flowing into the D 134
say every inch of D 132
saw smoke rising on D 132
sat waist deep in D 130
sad blank eyes at D 130
saw seven sail of D 128
sat plump down on D 128
sad gloom over the D 128
say would ever be D 122
sang hymns during the D 122
sad havoc upon the D 122
say boils down to D 119
say which bears the D 118
saw rural life as D 118
saw blade will be D 115
say would tend to D 114
say hello when the D 112
saw flags come up D 110
sat sipping iced tea D 110
sang every note of D 110
sad winds told us D 110
sang every word of D 108
saw urban life as D 107
saw people leaving the D 104
sang sweet songs as D 104
sad tidings will be D 104
say would help the D 103
saw would seem to D 103
saw gliding among the D 102
sat squat upon the D 102
sat sadly leaning on D 102
sang hymns along the D 102
saw people lining up D 101
say blast hell to D 100
sad scene came on D 100
say would fall so D 98
say hello when it D 98
sat staring ahead at D 98
sap dried upon the D 98
say hello during the D 97
saw moses when he D 96
sang hymns such as D 96
sat talking till it D 94
sat prating here of D 94
sat nodding over the D 94
sat lingering over the D 94
say would give me D 92
say draws from me D 92
saw smoke over the D 92
saw looming ahead the D 92
saw lamps coming on D 92
saw gliding along the D 92
sat still pining on D 92
say would have an D 90
say about race in D 90
say would make an D 88
say wages were at D 88
sat smoking upon the D 88
sap again rose in D 88
sang about what he D 88
saw moses full in D 86
saw dangling from the D 86
say which horn of D 84
sap rises into the D 84
saw every soul in D 82
sad sight when the D 82
sac would have to D 82
saw eight sail in D 80
sat alone atop the D 80
sap stirs early in D 80
sad lines rose to D 80
sad havoc among my D 80
saw bites into the D 51
sac springing from the D 50
sap drips from the D 49
sap issuing from the D 41

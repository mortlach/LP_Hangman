mutation which alters its D 114
muscles whose fibers are D 112
mundane world around him D 106
murrain which forced him D 100
muscles which extend and D 94
muscles showing through his D 94
muscles which oppose and D 92
muffler close around her D 88
musical voice called out D 86
musical world through his D 80
musical sound swells out D 80

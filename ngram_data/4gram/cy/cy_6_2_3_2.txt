cycles as long as D 665
cycles is due to D 664
cycles in both the D 516
cycles is one of D 506
cycles is that of D 486
cycles of both the D 480
cycles of two or D 432
cycles of each of D 374
cycles of two to D 332
cycles to get the D 288
cycles to see if D 284
cycles by using the D 218
cycles at each of D 216
cycles of all of D 202
cycles of one or D 200
cycles is not the D 190
cycles in that it D 184
cycles as far as D 180

cycled as far as D 137
cycles as low as D 136
cycles is not so D 132
cycles to that of D 124
cycles it can be D 124
cyclic in that the D 122
cycles of six to D 122
cycles is that it D 122
cycles is not an D 122
cycles on each of D 118
cycles of six or D 116
cycles to read the D 108
cycles in use in D 108
cycles by use of D 108
cycles to bring the D 104
cycles is that in D 104
cycles is not as D 99
cycles is not to D 94
cycles of use of D 86
cycles of one of D 84
cycles is for the D 82
cycled so that the D 43

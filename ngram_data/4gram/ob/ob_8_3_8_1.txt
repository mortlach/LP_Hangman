observed that whenever a M 1280
observed and recorded a M 393
observed that whenever i M 356
obstacle that prevents a M 242
obsessed with developing a M 225
observed with interest a M 216
observed and reported a M 211
observed that wherever a M 188
observed with surprise a M 166
objected and demanded a M 164
obedient and therefore i M 120
observes that whenever a M 116
observer can perceive a M 114
observed was probably a M 108
obtained and therefore a M 104
obtained and recorded a M 104
objected and obtained a M 104
observer has recorded a M 101
obtained that provides a M 100
obtained and deserved a M 100
observer may perceive a M 100
observed and analyzed a M 97
observed and provides a M 90
observed and therefore a M 88
observer can identify a M 86
observed them committing a M 86
obtained and provides a M 84
observed that scarcely a M 84
obviously this requires a D 322
obtained and executed a D 298
obviously this involves a D 232
obviously this presents a D 174
obtained may indicate a D 80

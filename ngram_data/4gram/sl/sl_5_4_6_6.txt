sleep these tedious nights M 126
slept three nights before M 88
sleep these twelve nights M 82
slope their pointing spires D 1056
sleek boat nibbling margin D 132
sliding door closed behind D 130
slope more gently toward D 120
sleep from hollow fields D 118
sliding among broken stumps D 100
slain your brother through D 90
slabs laid without mortar D 45

slept very soundly indeed M 106
slept there himself without M 106
slept there several nights M 41
sleep during alcohol intake D 222
slept like overfed hounds D 188
slake their youthful passion D 148
slips into juniper shadow D 124
slope like starved wolves D 122
sleep such ghastly visions D 100
slope were crouching amongst D 92
sloping away steeply before D 90
slope more steeply upward D 90

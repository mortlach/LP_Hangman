ends deemed just and M 538
ends beyond their own M 173
ends regard those who M 122
ends pointing north and M 120
envy passed over her M 118
ends streaming down his M 100
ends through their own M 96
ends something like this M 90
ends turned down and M 84
envy enters into his M 82
ends tucked into his D 196
ends lapped over each D 118
ends dangled from his D 116

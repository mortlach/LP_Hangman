temperature rises too far D 143
temperature change can not D 142

temperature where you are D 102
temperature change was not D 102
temperature water bath was D 100
temporarily staying with his D 98

temperature ranges for both D 97

temperature alone was not D 94
teleological proof for god D 94
temperature ranges are low D 93
territories which they did D 92
territories where they may D 92
temperature value for each D 92

temperature change and that D 90
testimonies about how they D 88

territories which they and D 86

temperature scale for all D 86
temperature falling too low D 84
telegraphed again for all D 84
temperature where they can D 82

territories which had for D 80

temperature change and are D 59
temperature change did not D 57
temperature water bath with D 56

temperature change are not D 54
tetrahedral sites and one D 53

temperature waste heat can D 48

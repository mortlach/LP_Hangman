barely spoken a word M 1076
battle without a plan M 274
battle became a hand M 205
barely lasted a month M 160
battle without a single M 132
barely played a role M 128
battle became a wild M 118
barely lasted a week M 118
battle lasted a week M 108
battle lasted a full M 106
battle without a hope M 98
battle became a test M 96
battle became a rout D 750
barely lifted a finger D 396
barely broken a sweat D 396
barely scraping a living D 236
barely uttering a word D 176
barely scrape a living D 141
barrel through a hole D 136
battle became a mere D 134
batter through a fine D 131
barely stifling a yawn D 128
basket without a word D 118
barely caused a stir D 108
barely stifle a yawn D 104

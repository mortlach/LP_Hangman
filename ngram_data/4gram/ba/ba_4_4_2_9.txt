back upon the sovereign D 66
back down or apologize D 66
back home by nightfall D 63
back upon the spectator D 56
back lens of objective D 56
back into the satellite D 52
back from the encroaching D 52
back flow of electrons D 50
back onto the scaffolding D 48
back into the episcopal D 48
back from the amplifier D 45
back upon the provincial D 44
back from the dashboard D 43
back upon the secretary D 41
back into the aggregate D 41
back from the occipital D 41
back like an infuriated D 40
back into the renovated D 40
back into the hurricane D 40
back into the blacksmith D 40
back from the crusaders D 40
back along the overgrown D 40

alone as i am M 2533
alive as i am M 1466
alone as i do M 1410
alone is a thing M 586
alive if i do M 412
alone if i am M 360
alone if i do M 342
alone am i in M 237
aloud in a sing M 232
alone as a thing M 192
aloud as i do M 184
alone in a ring M 182
alive as i do M 126
alone as a king M 124
alone in a wing M 110
alive if i am M 110
alone in a no M 109
alone in a by M 106
allow me i am M 106
alone is a king M 96
alone so i do M 94
alone am i to M 92
altar as i do M 82
alone or i do M 42
alone in a sea D 2405
alone on a sea D 340
aloof as a so D 176
alive in a sea D 90

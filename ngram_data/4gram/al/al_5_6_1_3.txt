alone regard a man M 1406
allow myself a few M 1192
alone without a man M 560
alone enable a man M 272
alone amongst a lot M 198
alive through a long M 174
alive except a few M 128
alone offers a way M 116
alone created a new M 112
alone yields a net M 107
alive unless i won M 106
alone unless i was M 102
alone before i was M 96
alone whilst i was M 84
allow myself a bit M 84
alive beyond a few M 84
alone through a long M 80
alley behind a row D 316
alley behind a bar D 298
alone exalts a man D 120
album became a hit D 106
alone through a fir D 104
alone without a gun D 100
alone before i met D 88
album without a pang D 84
alone reached a peak D 41
alone render a man D 40

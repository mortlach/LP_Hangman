numberless too are the M 111
nucleotides that can be D 546
nucleotides can not be D 460
numerators and put the D 312
nucleotides long and is D 305
numerators and then the D 266
nucleotides that are the D 234
nucleotides and that the D 188
nucleotides long can be D 159
numerators and use the D 156
nucleotides long and the D 127
nucleotides that are in D 110
nucleotides and can be D 102
nucleotides that may be D 100
nucleotides may not be D 92
nucleotides can then be D 80

keep dust from blowing D 84
keep your heart fresh D 82
keep clean their souls D 82
keep your lamp burning D 81
keep your damn money D 80
keep their pets under D 80
keep your eyes level D 70
kept free from oxide D 55
keep your lips tight D 53
keep your mouth close D 49
keep your lawn green D 45
keep your nose outta D 44

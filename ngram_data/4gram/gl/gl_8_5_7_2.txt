glistening white against the D 324
glaciers which covered the D 238
glimmering light invited me D 152
glaciers which descend to D 136
glittering white against the D 128
glistening white surface of D 124
glimmering light appeared to D 120
glycogen still present in D 106
glittering brass against the D 106
globular brass buttons on D 104
glaciers still remaining in D 100
gladness which attends the D 98
glimmering light appeared at D 96
glittering lines extending to D 92
glimmering light revealed the D 82

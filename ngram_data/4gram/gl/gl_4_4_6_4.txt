glad when someone else M 219
glad when winter came M 156
glad when monday came M 124
glad when summer came M 90
glad when orders came M 82
glow like molten gold D 474
glean their meadows side D 363
glen more forest park D 244
glad when midday come D 162
glen cove avenue glen D 124
gleam like molten gold D 40

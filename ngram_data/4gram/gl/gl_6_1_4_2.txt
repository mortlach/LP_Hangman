gloomy a view of M 3808
glancing a look at M 972
glancing a look of M 316
glance a view of M 161
gloomy a view as M 159
gladly i will do M 146
glance a face of M 136
glance i cast at M 130
glance i gave to M 128
glance a look of M 111
gloomy a view to M 82
gladly i heard the M 82
glance a sort of M 47
gleamed a pair of D 812
glands a pair of D 393
glance i took in D 355
gleaned a wealth of D 230
glance i threw at D 213
glance i took to D 194
glowed a pair of D 190
gleamed a sort of D 164
glance i took at D 156
glance i took of D 148
glance i took it D 128
gloves a pair of D 120
gleamed a line of D 110
glared a pair of D 102
glance i flung at D 84
gleamed a hint of D 80

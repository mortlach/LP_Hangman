glorified body which is M 108
glorified body after the M 103
glorified body shall be M 50
glittered like chips of D 284
gladdened their hearts by D 266
glittered like stars in D 228
glutinous rice which is D 162
glutinous scum found in D 146
glistened like glass in D 138
glimmered like threads of D 138
glistened pale above the D 124
gleefully from point to D 120
glittered like steel in D 114
glistened like drops of D 100
gladdened their hearts so D 100
glamorous young woman in D 90
glittered from under the D 88
glimmered like stars in D 88
glorified body would be D 49

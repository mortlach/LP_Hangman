glad voice across an M 100
glow which seemed to D 638
glue small pieces of D 594
glow shone through the D 510
glow shining through the D 384
glow spread across the D 370
gluing small pieces of D 249
gleam which seemed to D 248
glad tidings through the D 244
gleam shining through the D 219
gleam shone through the D 193
glow still lingered in D 188
glow spread through the D 188
glad tidings should be D 158
glad tidings reached the D 152
glue strong enough to D 150
glow which lights up D 134
glow rises behind the D 128
glow spread through me D 122
glow which filled the D 116
glow showing through the D 116
gleam crept amongst the D 112
glow after striking the D 108
glow under plumes of D 106
glow seeping through the D 98
glue extra scraps of D 94
glow breaks through the D 94
glow which covers the D 90
glow spread through my D 82
gleam white through the D 43

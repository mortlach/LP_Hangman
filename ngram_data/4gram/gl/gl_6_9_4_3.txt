global knowledge base and M 126
glance sometimes upon one M 125
gloomy expression pass off M 108

glancing repeatedly over his M 82
glancing nervously over his D 834
glancing nervously over her D 632
glancing furtively over his D 390
gloomy forebodings were not D 360
glance flickered over her D 238
glance flickered over our D 188
gladly entertain into his D 186
glancing furtively over her D 106
global population size and D 102
glands scattered over its D 102
gloomy forebodings were too D 98

glancing nervously from one D 90
glance flickered over him D 86
global vegetation maps with D 84
global leadership role for D 84

glad when morning came M 1322
glad when night came M 634
glad when evening came M 188
glad when people like M 138
glad when night fell M 124
glad your mother will M 106
glad nothing could make M 100
glean what others have D 134
glad aunt march gave D 110
gleam like light from D 106
gleam over white teeth D 94
glad news spread like D 94
glean some facts from D 92
glad book trade mark D 92
glow from within like D 40

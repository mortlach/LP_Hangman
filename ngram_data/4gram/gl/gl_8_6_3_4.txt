glycogen stores are used D 353
glimmering vaults with iron D 250
glittering silver and gold D 236

glistening through its coat D 114
glimmering arches that span D 100
glycogen stores had been D 93
glittering through his blue D 92
glycogen stores are high D 84
glittering knives and saws D 80
glassier streams than thine D 40

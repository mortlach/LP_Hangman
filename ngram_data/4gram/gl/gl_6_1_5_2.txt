gladly i spread my M 746
gloomy a place as M 172
gladly i serve my M 155
gloomy a sense of M 128
glance a group of M 80
gladly i would do D 766
gladly i would be D 418
glared a warning at D 248
gleaned a sense of D 152
gladly i would go D 152
glowed a spark of D 94
glands a gland is D 42
globes a globe is D 40

glorified creations of god M 168
glorified himself in his M 124
glorified according to his M 120
glorified himself in that M 98
glorified spirits of his M 84
gloriously declining to lie D 170
glorifies himself in his D 160
gloriously ushered in our D 120
glittered against the sky D 116
glandular stomach of rat D 114
gloomiest problem of this D 96
gloomiest moments of that D 94
glorifies himself in all D 92
gloriously faithful to both D 88
glittered briefly in his D 88

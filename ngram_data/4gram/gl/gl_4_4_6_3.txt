glad your brother had M 236
glad when school was M 202
glad your scheme for M 194
glad days before they M 142
glad when dinner was D 440
glad when supper was D 192
glow flow through her D 150
glow deep inside her D 112
glad your phlegm can D 110
glen more slowly than D 102
gleam shot athwart his D 92
gleam shot across his D 87

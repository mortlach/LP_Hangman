gloomily shook his head D 674
glittering ranks with wings D 602
glimmering above his head D 248
glistening roofs and sang D 224
glimpses every now and D 189
glistering grief and wear D 154
glimpses which are now D 142
glaciers which are now D 112
gloomily shaking his head D 102
glimmering light that was D 102
globules which are not D 100
gloomier sense than with D 98
glimpses charm him too D 95
glittering above his head D 94
gloomily waiting for her D 88
glittering world with all D 82
glycogen rather than fat D 56
glittering knife that was D 48

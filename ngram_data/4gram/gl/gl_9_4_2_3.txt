glorified body of our M 995
glorified body is not M 216
glorified when we are M 148
glorified only by you M 142
glorified when we bear M 122
glorified sons of god M 103
glorified life of our M 91
glittered like the sun D 642
glittered down at her D 592
glassware used in this D 475
glistened like the sun D 356
gloriously from the east D 278
glittered back at her D 246
gloriously from the dead D 229
gloomiest days of his D 208
gladdened heart to that D 208
gleefully told me that D 195
glittered back at him D 192
glistened when he saw D 168
glistened when the sun D 153
gladiators whom he had D 146
glittered when the sun D 114
gladiators used to say D 112
glamorous life in new D 110
glowworms from the leaf D 108
gleefully told me how D 104
glassware must be dry D 102
gleefully into the air D 100
gloriously rest in that D 98
glittered when he saw D 96
gladdened heart to see D 88
gloriously over the earth D 86
glistened from the heat D 86
gladdened when he saw D 82
glimmered like the day D 40

twisted from around the D 378
twisted back toward the D 293
twisted upon itself in D 292
twisted just enough to D 272
twisted their bodies in D 210
twisted from sweeping up D 198
twisted upon itself to D 190
twisted wire through the D 186
twinkling eyes seemed to D 177
twisted back around to D 162
twisted their tongues to D 134
twisted once around the D 128
twisted pair cables to D 127
twisted their bodies to D 118
twinkling down through the D 114
twisted upon itself so D 103
twisted down through the D 98
twisted ends should be D 94
twisted their waists in D 90
twisted upon itself as D 89
twisted into shapes the D 88
twisted stem almost of D 84
twisted into shapes of D 80
twisted down toward the D 55
twisted wire around the D 52

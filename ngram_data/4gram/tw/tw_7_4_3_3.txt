twisted free and ran D 240
twinkling eyes and his D 216

twisted hair and his D 162
twisted atop her head D 156
twisted from him and D 150
twisted over her head D 146

twisted into two long D 124
twitching their ears and D 108
twigged what was going D 104
twisted ends are then D 103
twitching along his jaw D 96
twisted along its long D 96
twisted cold with one D 94
twisted when they are D 82
twisted over his head D 82
twisted into one long D 80
twinkling eyes and long D 46

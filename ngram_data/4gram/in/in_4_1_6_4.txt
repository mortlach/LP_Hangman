into a throbbing ache D 50
into a stinking rice D 49
into a stucco wall D 48
into a pretty dining D 48
into a normal atom D 48
into a closer shot D 47
into a twenty foot D 46
into a deeper funk D 45
into a packed mass D 44
into a tapering tail D 43
into a bluish grey D 43
into a police road D 42
into a hollow void D 42
into a fuller self D 42
into a corral full D 42
into a whirling blur D 41
into a feathery mass D 41
into a twelve foot D 40
into a stupor once D 40
into a serious drug D 40
into a morbid self D 40

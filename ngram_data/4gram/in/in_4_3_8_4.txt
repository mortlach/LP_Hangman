into his notebook from D 92
into his clinical work D 92
into her hospital gown D 92

into our driveway just D 88
into one standard form D 88
into his threadbare coat D 88
into his presence wearing D 88

into one compound tone D 80
into his stricken eyes D 80
into his driveway when D 80
into that hostelry well D 49

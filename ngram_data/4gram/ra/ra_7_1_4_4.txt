rainbow i have ever M 389
ravaged a great part D 874
radical a break from D 192
rascals i ever heard D 180
rafters a third time D 168
rallied a great many D 148
ravishing a kiss from D 122
rascals i have ever D 102
rallied a great part D 96
rapture i felt when D 59
rambles i came upon D 41

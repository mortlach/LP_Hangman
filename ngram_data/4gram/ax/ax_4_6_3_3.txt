axis through one end D 2769
axis powers did not D 646
axis through its own D 613
axis powers are not D 356
axis system with its D 334
axis powers and that D 291
axis pointing east and D 227
axis causes day and D 204
axis powers and was D 198
axis powers are going D 194
axis through its end D 167
axis agents and our D 162
axis powers had won D 160
axis powers had not D 158
axis powers and then D 158
axial forces are not D 156
axis powers was not D 122

axial stress does not D 104

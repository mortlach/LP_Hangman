axis is not a D 1817
axis so that a D 1061
axis of lead i D 461
axes to cut a D 412
axis by using a D 303
axes so that a D 229
axes is not a D 183
axon is not a D 160
axis is then a D 159
axis is now a D 151
axis we get a D 141
axis is thus a D 133
axis to get a D 132
axed me for a D 112
axed me was i D 104

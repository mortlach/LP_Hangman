sing better than others M 211
sing before and after M 210
sing praise and glory M 158
sing before she could M 118
sing louder than usual M 100
sing another song within M 92
sing before they could M 90
sing louder and longer M 42
sing psalms and hymns D 2598
sing through her veins D 262
sing matins and lauds D 105
sing through our sighing D 92

sip the last drop D 88
sip of fine wine D 86
singing to their oars D 86
sit in their stead D 85
sit at home moping D 84
singing to some tune D 84
sin to take pears D 84
sit on your skin D 82
sit on their desk D 82
sit on high seats D 82
sit on your nose D 80
singing the last bars D 80
six by nine foot D 51
sin at least once D 46
six by four foot D 41

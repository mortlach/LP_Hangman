ugly turn when the M 172
ugly face into the M 170
ugly wind from the M 156
ugly ones cease to M 130
ugly talk among the M 124
ugly face when he M 118
ugly face full of M 94
ugly soot from the D 288
ugly blot upon the D 216
ugly gash made in D 144
ugly scar upon the D 128
ugly mood over the D 124
ugly mood among the D 80
ugly gash along the D 80

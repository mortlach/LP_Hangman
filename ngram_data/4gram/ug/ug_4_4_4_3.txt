ugly look came and M 190
ugly look upon his M 106
ugly face when she M 98
ugly truth came out M 88
ugly face among them M 86
ugly hell gape not D 149
ugly scar upon his D 114
ugly scar over his D 114
ugly mood when they D 112
ugly lump were but D 92
ugly nose into our D 88
ugly scar down his D 84
ugly mugs when they D 84
